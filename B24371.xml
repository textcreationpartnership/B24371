            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                     </gap>, they are but abortive things, and meer Embryos; nay, they have no life at all in them till the KING puts breath and vigour into them: and the antient custome was for the KING to touch them with His <hi>Scepter,</hi> then they are Lawes, and have a virtue in them to impose an obligation of universall obedience upon all sorts of people, It being an undeniable maxime, That <hi>nothing can be generally binding without the King's royall assent,</hi> nor doth the Law of <hi>England</hi> take notice of any thing without it: This being done, they are ever after stil'd <hi>the King's Lawes,</hi> and the Judges are said to deliver the King's judgments, which agrees with the holy Text, <hi>The King by judgment shall stablish the Land:</hi> nay, the Law presumes the <hi>King</hi> to be alwaies the sole Judge Paramount, and Lord chief Justice of <hi>England,</hi> for he whom He pleaseth to depute for His chiefest Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, is but stil'd <hi>Lord chief Justice of the King's Bench,</hi> not Lord chief Justice of <hi>England,</hi> which title is peculiar to the KING Himself, and observable it is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as He grants Commissions and Patents to the Lord Chancellour (who is no other then <hi>Keeper of His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94588:6"/> and to all other Judges, He names the Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of His own Bench by a short Writ only containing two or three lines: Now, though the <hi>King</hi> be liable to the Law, and is contented to be within their verge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are chiefly His owne productions, yet He is still their Protector, Moderator, and Soveraigne, which attributes are incommunicable to any other conjunctly or separately.</p>
                  <p>Thus the KING with His <hi>Scepter,</hi> and by the mature advice of His two Houses of Parl. which are His highest Councel &amp; Court, hath the sole power of making Laws; other Courts of judicature doe but expound them and distribute them by His appointment, they have but <hi>Juris dati dictionem</hi> or <hi>declarationem,</hi> and herein, I meane for the Exposition of the Lawes <hi>the twelve Judges</hi> are to be <hi>believed before the whole Kingdom besides.</hi> They are as the Areopagites in <hi>Athens,</hi> the chief Presidents in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> in an extraordinary <hi>Junta,</hi> as the <hi>Cape-Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diques</hi> in the <hi>Rota's</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Republique of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> whose judgments in point of interpreting Lawes are incontroulable, and preferred before the opinion of the whole Senate whence they received their being; and who hath still power to repeal them, though not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them. In <hi>France</hi> they have a Law-maxime, <hi>Arrest donnÃ© en Robbe rouge est irrevocable,</hi> which is, <hi>a Scarlet Sentence is irrevocable,</hi> meaning when all the Judges are met in their Robes, and the Client against whom the Cause goes, may chafe and chomp upon the bit, and say what he will for the space of 24 howers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Judges, but if ever after he traduces them, he is punishable: It is no otherwise here where every igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant peevish Client, every puny Barister, specially if he become a Member of the House will be ready to arraign and vie knowledge with all the reverend Judges in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94588:6"/> Land, whose judgement in points of Law shold be only tripodicall and sterling: so that he may be truly call'd a just King, and to rule according to Law, who rules ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of his Judges; therfore, under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, I do not see how his Majestie for his part could be call'd injust when he leavied the Ship-money, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had the judges for it.</p>
                  <p>I now take the <hi>Sword</hi> in hand, which is the third Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of a King, (and which this short discours chiefly <hi>points</hi> at) it is aswell as the two first, incommunicable and inalienable from his Person; nothing concernes his honor more both at home and abroad; the <hi>Crown</hi> and the Scepter are but unweildy and impotent naked indefen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible things without it. There's none so simple as to think there's meant hereby an ordinary single sword, such as ev'ry one carrieth by his side, or som imaginary thing or chymera of a sword; No, 'tis the polemical publique sword of the whole Kingdom, 'tis an aggregative com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound sword, and 'tis moulded of bell-metall; for 'tis made up of all the ammunition and armes small and great, of all the military strengths both by Land and Sea, of all the Forts, Castles and tenable places within and round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the whole Ile: The Kings of England have had this sword by vertue of their royall signory from all times, the Laws have girded it to their sides, they have employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for repelling all forren force, for revenging all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren wrongs or affronts, for quelling all intestine tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and for protecting the weal of the whole body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike at home: The peeple were never capable of this sword, the fundamentall constitutions of this Kingdom deny it them; 'tis all one to put the sword in a mad mans hand, as in the peeples; or for them to have a disposing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94588:7"/> power in whose hands it shall be. Such was the case once of the French sword, in that notorious insurrection call'd to this day <hi>La Jaqueris de Beauvoisin,</hi> when the Pesants and Mechanics had a design to wrest it out of the Kings hand, and to depresse all the Peers &amp; Gentry of the Kingdom; &amp; the busines had gone very far, had not the <hi>Prelats</hi> stuck close to the Nobility; But afterwards poor hare-brain'd things they desire the King upon bended knees to take it againe; Such popular puffs have blowen often in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Naples</hi> and other places, where while they sought and fought for liberty by retrenching the regall power, they fool'd themselfs into a slavery unawares, and found the rule right, that <hi>excess of freedom turns to thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and ushers in all confusions. If one shold go back to the nonage of the world, when Governers and Rulers began first, one will find the peeple desir'd to live under Kings for their own advantage, that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd from wild exorbitant liberty, and kept in unity; Now <hi>unity</hi> is as requisit for the welbeing of all naturall things, as <hi>entity</hi> is for their being, and 'tis a receiv'd max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im in policy, that nothing pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ves Unity more exactly then Royall Government: besides 'tis known to be the noblest sort of sway; In so much that by the Law of Nations, if Subjects of equall degrees, and under differing Princes shold meet, the Subjects of a King shold take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of those under any Republique, and those of a <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessif</hi> Kingdom, of those that are under an Electif.</p>
                  <p>But to take up the <hi>Sword</hi> again. I say that the <hi>Sword</hi> of public power &amp; authoritie is fit only to hang at the Kings side, &amp; so indeed shold the <hi>great Seal</hi> hang only at his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, because 'tis the Key of the Kingdom: which makes me think of what I read of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> how he had the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Seal emboss'd alwaies upon the pommell of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94588:7"/> sword, and his reason was, that he was ready to maintain whatsoever he signed, and sealed.</p>
                  <p>The Civilians, who are not in all points so great friends to Monarchy as the Common Law of England is, say, there are six <hi>Iura Regalia,</hi> six Regall Rights, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas Iudicatoria,</hi> 2. <hi>Potestas vitae &amp; necis,</hi> 3. <hi>Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta,</hi> 4. <hi>Bona adespota,</hi> 5. <hi>Census,</hi> 6. <hi>Monetarum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor:</hi> to wit, <hi>Power of Judicature, power of life and death, all kind of arming, masterlesse goods, Sessements,</hi> and <hi>the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among these <hi>Regalias,</hi> we find that <hi>Arming,</hi> which in effect is nought else but the Kings <hi>Sword,</hi> is among the chiefest; and 'tis as proper and peculiar to his person, as either Crown or Scepter. By these two he drawes a loose voluntary love and opinion onely from his Subjects, but by the <hi>Sword</hi> he drawes reverence and awe, which are the chiefest ingredients of allegiance, it being a maxime, <hi>That the best mixture of government is made of feare and love.</hi> With this sword he conferrs honor, he dubbs Knights, he creates magistrats, the Lord Deputy of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Lord Mayor of London with all other Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations have their swords from him, and when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth any place corporat, we know the first thing that is presented him is the <hi>Sword:</hi> With this Sword he shields and preserves all his peeple that ev'ry one may sit quietly under his own Vine, sleep securely in his own House, and enjoy sweetly the fruits of his labours.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the point of this sword reach only to ev'ry corner of his own dominions, but it extends beyond the seas to gard his Subjects from oppression, and denial of justice, as well as to vindicate the publike wrongs, make good the interests of his Crown, and to assist his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates; This is the sword that <hi>Edward</hi> the third tied the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94588:8"/>
                     <hi>Flower deluces</hi> unto (which stick still unto it,) when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sent to France to demand that Crown by maternall right, the Counsell there sent him word that the <hi>Crown of France was not tied to a distaff,</hi> to which <hi>scoffing</hi> answer he replied <hi>that then he wold tie it to his sword,</hi> and he was as good as his word. Nor is this publike sword concredited or intrusted by the <hi>peeple</hi> in a fiduciary conditionall way to the King, but it is properly and peculiarly belonging unto him, as an inseparable concomitant, perpetuall Usher and attendant to his Crowne. The King, we know, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to maintain all garrisons upon his own charge, not the peeples; he fortifies upon his own charge, not the pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: And though I will not averr, that the King may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse any of his Subjects, unlesse it be upon an actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion by Sea, or a sudden irruption into his Kingdom by Land, as the Scots have often don, yet at any time the King may raise Volunteers, and those who have received his money, the Law makes it <hi>felony,</hi> if they forsake his service.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see there's nothing that conduceth more to the glory, and indeed the very essence of a King then the <hi>Sword,</hi> which is the Armes and military strength of his Kingdome; wherfore under favor, there cannot be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter point of dishonor to a King then to be disarmed, then to have his Sword taken from him, or dispos'd of and intrusted to any but those whom he shall appoint; for as <hi>Ã  minori ad majus.</hi> the Argument often holds, if a privat Gentleman chance to be disarm'd upon a quarrell, 'tis held the utmost of disgraces, much greater and more public is the dishonor that falls upon a King, if after some traverses of difference 'twixt him and his Subjects, they shold offer to disarme him, or demand his sword of him: when the Eagle parted with his talons, and the Lion with his teeth and ongles, the Apolog tells us how
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94588:8"/> contemptible afterwards the one grew to be among Birds, the other among Beasts. For a King to part with the Sword politic is to render himself such a ridiculous King, as that logg of wood was which <hi>Jupiter</hi> let down among the froggs for their King at the importunity of their croaking; 'tis to make him a King of clouts, or as the Spaniard hath it, <hi>Rey de Havas,</hi> a Bean-King, such as we use to choose in sport at Twelf-night.</p>
                  <p>But my hopes are, that the two present Houses of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement (for now they may be call'd so, because they begin to <hi>parley</hi> with their King,) wilbe more tender of the honor of their Soverain Liege Lord, which, together with all his Rights and Dignities, by severall solemn Oaths, and by their own binding instruments of <hi>Protestation and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> (not yet revok'd) they are sworn to maintain, and that they will demand nothing of him which may savour of <hi>AspertÃ¨</hi> or force, but what may hold water hereafter: But now, touching the <hi>Militia</hi> or Sword of the Kingdom, I think, under favor, the King cannot transfer it to any other; for that were to desert the protection of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is point-blank against his Coronation Oath and his Office: What forren Prince or State will send either <hi>Ambassador, Resident</hi> or <hi>Agent</hi> to him, when they understand his Sword is taken from him? What reformed forren Church wil acknowledg Him <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> when they hear of this? Nay, they who wish England no good will, will go neer to paint him out, as not long since another King was, with a fair velvet Scabbard, a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious golden hilt and chape, but the blade within was of wood. I hope that they who sway now, will make bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter use of their successes: Many of them know 'tis as <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a thing to use a victory well, as to get one;</hi> there is as much prudence requir'd in the one, as prowesse in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94588:9"/> they wilbe wiser sure then turn it to the dishonor of their King: it being a certaine rule, that the glory of a Nation all the world over depends upon the glory of their King, and if he be any way obscur'd, the whole Kingdom is under an eclipse.</p>
                  <p>I have observed, that among other characters of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, which forren Writers appropriat to the English Nation, one is, that they use to be most zealous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Honor of their King; I trust that they who are now upp will return to the steps of their Progenitors, both in this particular and divers other; that their successes may serve to sweeten and moderat things, and suppresse the popular Sword which still rages; And it had been hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wished that a suspension of Arms had preceded this Treaty, which useth to be the ordinary fore-runner, and a necessarie antecedent to all Treaties; for while acts of hostility continue, som ill favour'd newes may intervene which may imbitter and disturb all: nor can it be expected that the proceedings will goe on with that candor and confidence, while the old rancor is still in action; 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible a sore shold heale till the inflamation be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; To cast <hi>water</hi> into a wound instead of <hi>oyle</hi> is not the way to cure it: or to cast <hi>oyle</hi> upon a fire instead of <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is not the way to quench it; poor England hath had a consuming fire within her bowells many yeeres, she is also mortally wounded in all her members, that she is still in a high Fever, which hath made her rave and speak idle a long time; and 'tis like to turn to a <hi>Hectic</hi> if not timely prevented. I p ay God she may have no occasion to make use of the same complaint as <hi>Alexander</hi> the great made when he was expiring his last, <hi>Perti turba Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicorum: too many Physitians have undon me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude in a word, there is but one only way, under
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94588:9"/> favor, to put a period to all these fearfull confusions; it is, to put the great Master-wheele in order, and in its due place again, and then all the inferior wheels will move regularly; let the King be restor'd, and ev'ry one will com to his own, all interests will be satisfied, all things quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rectified; till this be done, 'tis as absurd to attempt the setling of peace, as if one shold go about to set a Watch by the gnomon of an horizontall Diall when the Sun is in a cloud.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y last to your Eminence was but short, in regard I had been but a short time in this Countrey, I have now made a longer sojourn here, and taken a lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely information of all matters; therefore I shal give your Eminence an account proportionably: For by conversation with the most indifferent, and intelligenc'd men, and by communication with the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors here resident, I have taken some paines to pump out the truth of things.</p>
                  <p>I find, that angry star, which hath lowr'd so long upon <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94588:12"/> in generall, hath been as predominant, and cast as direfull aspects upon this poor Iland, as upon any other part: Truly, my Lord, in all probability this people have pass'd the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of their happinesse, and begin to decline extreamly, as well in <hi>Repute</hi> abroad, as also in the common notions of <hi>Religion,</hi> and indeed in the ordinary faculty of <hi>Reason:</hi> I think verily the Ill Spirit never reign'd so much in any corner of the earth by those inhumane and horid things that I have observ'd among them, Nor is it a petty Spirit, but one of the greatest Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemons that thus drives them on, and makes them so active in the pursuance of their own perdition.</p>
                  <p>To deduce matters from their Originall, Your Eminency may please to understand, that this King at his accesse to the Crown had deep debts to pay, both of His Fathers, and his own, he was left ingaged in a fresh warre with <hi>Spain;</hi> and had another presently after with <hi>France,</hi> and both at one time, but he came off well enough of those: Afterwards never any Countrey flourished in that envied happinesse, and wanton kind of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; This City of <hi>London</hi> was grown to be the greatest Mart, and mistresse of Trade, of any in the world, Insomuch, as I have been certainly inform'd, the King might have eaten meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon His customes 4000 crownes a day: Moreover, she had a vast bank of money being made the <hi>scale</hi> of conveying the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> treasure to <hi>Flanders:</hi> Insomuch that in a few yeers she had above ten millions of his moneys brought hither, which she might have remitted in <hi>specie</hi> or in marchandize, and for which this King had five in the hundred for coynage: Yet could he not get beforehand with the world, having a sister with so many Nephews and neeces, having a Queen with diverse children of His own, (at least 16 of the Blood-Royall) to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, with divers profuse Courtiers besides, which made Him more parsimonious then ordinary. The Warres then growing more active 'twixt <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as also 'twixt <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> both by Land and Sea, and divers great Fleets of Men
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94588:12"/> of War as well <hi>French</hi> (who were growne powerfull that way) as <hi>Dunkerkers, Spaniards, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Hamburgers,</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring daily in His narrow Seas, and sayling close by His <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> the world wondred this King had no greater strength at Sea, in case that any of the foresaid Nations should doe him an affront, as some of them had already done, by denying to dash their Colours to His Ships: Insomuch that in <hi>Holland</hi> and other places he was pasquill'd at, and pourtrayed lying in his cradle lullaby'd and rock'd asleep by the Spaniard: Hereupon being by advertisements from His Agents abroad, and frequent advice of His Privie Councell at home, made sensible of the danger, and a kind of dishonour he was falne into, and having intelligence that the French Cardinall began to question his title to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Narrow Seas, considering He employed no visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power to preserve it, He began to consult of meanes to set forth a Royall Fleet: but in regard the Purse of the Crowne was lightly ballasted, and that he had no mind to summon the three Estates, because of some indignities he had received in former Parliaments by the <hi>Puritan</hi> party, (a race of people averse to all Kingly Government, unlesse they may pare it as they please) his then Atturney Generall, a great cryed-up-Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, put it in his Head to impose an old Tax called <hi>Ship-mony</hi> upon the Subject, which the said Lawyer did warrant upon his life to be Legall, for he could produce diverse Records how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Progenitors had done the like: The King not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with his single opinion, referred it to His Learned Councell, and they unanimously averred it to be agreeable to the Law of the Land; yet this would not fully satisfie the King, but He would have the Opinion of His twelve Judges, and <hi>they</hi> also affirmed by their severall vouches the said Tax to be warrantable; Hereupon it was imposed and leavied, but some refusing to pay it, there was a suite commenc'd, during which all the Judges were to re-deliver their opinions joyntly, and the businesse being maturely debated and canvased in open
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94588:13"/> Court divers months, and all arguments produc'd <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> nine of the said twelve Judges concluded it Legal: Thereupon the King continued the imposition of the said Tax, and never was money imployed so much for the Honour and advantage of a Countrey, for he sent out every Summer a Royall fleet to scowre and secure the Seas; he caused a Galeon to be built, the greatest and gallantest that ever spread saile: Nor did he purse up, and dispose of one peny of this money to any other use, but added much of his own Revenues yeerly thereunto: So the world abroad cried up the King of <hi>England</hi> to be awake againe; <hi>Trade</hi> did wonderfully encrease, both Domestic and forrein in all the three Kingdomes; <hi>Ireland</hi> was reduced to an absolute Settlement, the Arreares of the Crown payed, and a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Revenue came thence cleerly to the Exchequer of <hi>England</hi> every year, the salaries of all Officers, with the pay of the stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Army there, and all other Charges being defrayed by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> her self, which was never done before. Yet for all this height of happinesse, and the glorious fruites of the said Ship-money, (which was but a kind of petty insensible Tax, &amp; a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to what hath happened since) there were some foolish people in this Land which murmured at it, and cryed out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a Parliament, a Parliament; and they have had one since with a vengeance.</p>
                  <p>But before this occasion, it was observed, that the seedes of disobedience, and a spirit of insurrection was a long time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring in the hearts of some of this peace-pampred People, which is conceived to proceed from their conversation and comerce with three sorts of men, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> the <hi>Hollander</hi> and the <hi>French Huguenot.</hi> Now an advantage happened that much conduced to necessitate the convoking of a Parliament, which was an ill-favoured traverse that fell out in <hi>Scotland;</hi> For the King intending an Uniformity of Divine worship in all His three Kingdomes, sent thither the <hi>Lyturgie</hi> of this Church, but it found cold and coorse entertainment there, for the whole
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94588:13"/> Nation, men, women and children rise up against them: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King absolutely revoked it by Proclamation, wherein He declared 'twas never His purpose to presse the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of upon the Consciences of any; therefore commanded that all things should be in <hi>statu quo prius,</hi> but this would not serve the turn, the <hi>Scot</hi> took advantage hereby to destroy <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> and pull down Bishops to get their demeanes: To which purpose they came with an Army in open Field against their own Native King, who not disgesting this indignity, Mustred another <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Army; which being upon the confines of both Kingdomes, a kind of Pacification was plaistred over for the present. The King returning to <hi>London,</hi> and consulting His second thoughts, resented that insolency of the <hi>Scots</hi> more then formerly: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon He summons a Parliament, and desires aid to Vindicat that Affront of the <hi>Scot.</hi> The <hi>Scot</hi> had strong Intelligence with the Puritan Faction in the <hi>English</hi> Parliament, who seemed to abet his quarell, rather then to be sensible of any nationall disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour received from him; which caused that short-lived Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to dissolve in discontent, and the King was forced to finde other meanes to raise and support an Army by private Loanes of His Nobler sort of Subjects and Servants: The <hi>Scot</hi> having punctuall Advertisments of every thing that passed, yea, in the Kings Cabinet Councell was not idle all this while, but rallies what was left of the former Army (which by the articles of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification should have been absolutely dismissed) and boldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades <hi>England,</hi> which he durst never have done, if he had not well known that this Puritan Party which was now grown very powerfull here, and indeed had invited him to this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would stand to him. This forrein Army being, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious close machinations of some mongrell <hi>Englishmen</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, entred into the Bowels of the Country, the King was forced to call this present Parliament, with whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in every thing, so far as to sacrifice unto them both Judge, Bishop, Councellor and Courtier; yea, He yeilded to the tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling down of many tribunalls of Justice, which were an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94588:14"/> to his Prerogative; He assented that the Prelates, who were the most Ancient and Prime Members of the upper House, and had priority of all others, since the first constitution of Parliament in the enrollment of all Acts, He assented I say that these, who were the greatest prop of His Crown should be quite outed from among the Peers; He granted them also a <hi>Trienniall</hi> Parliament, and after that, this <hi>Perpetuall;</hi> which words, to the apprehension of any rationall man, carry with them a grosse absurdity in the very sense of the thing: And touching this last Grant, I had it from a good hand, that the Queen was a friend to this Parliament, and your Eminence knowes how they have requited Her since, but the maine open Councellor to this fatall Act was a <hi>Scot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the reason which they alledged for this everlasting Parliament was one of the baldest that ever I heard of, it was, that they might have time enough to pay the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, whereas in one morning they might have dispatched that, by passing so many Subsidies for that use, and upon the credit of those, they might have raised what money they would.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament finding the King so pliable, and His pulse to beat so gently, like ill-natur'd men they fall from inches to ells in seeking their advantages: They grew so peremptory as to demand all the military strength of the Kingdom, the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> with the whole Royall Navy, which they found in an excellent equipage, gramercy shipmony; so that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Ship-mony, which they so clamoured at, turned most to their advantage of any thing afterwards.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scot</hi> being Fidler-like returned to his Country with meat, drink, and mony, the King went a while after to keep a Parliament there, wherein he filled every blank, they did but ask and have, for He granted them what possibly they could propound, both for their Kirk and State, many received Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and they divided Bishops Lands amongst them: for all which unparallel'd Concessions of Princely grace, they caused an Act already in force to be published, <hi>viz.</hi> that it should be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94588:14"/> damnable Treason in the highest degree that could be, for any of the Scots Nation conjunctly or singly to levy armes, or any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Forces, upon any pretext whatsoever, without His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties royall Commission; and this they caus'd to be don by way of gratitude, but how they perform'd it afterwards the world knowes too well.</p>
                  <p>The King returning to <hi>London,</hi> in lieu of a wellcom to his two Houses of Parliament (to whom also before his departure he had passed more Acts of Grace then all his Progenitors, take them all in a lump) they had patch'd up a kind of <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> which was voted in the dead of night, wherein they expos'd to the world the least moat in former government, and aggravated to the very height every grievance, all which the King had redressed before; and this <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> which breath d nothing but a base kind of malice, they presented as a nosegay to their Soverain Prince, to congratulate his safe return from a forren Countrey; which they caus'd to be printe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> &amp; publish'd before he could give any answer thereunto. The King finding such a viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent spirit still raign in the House, and knowing who were chiefly possess'd with it (whom he had impeach'd before, but saw he could get no justice against them) in such an extremity, he did an act like a generous Prince, for taking the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> with him, he took the first coach he met withall at his Court gate, and went to his House of Commons in person to demand five Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which he wold prove to be Traitors in the highest degree, and to be the Authors of all these distempers, protesting upon the word of a King, that they shold have as fair &amp; legall a tryall as ever men had; in the interim he only desir'd that their persons might be secur'd: The walls of both Houses, and the very stones in London street did seem to ring of this high cariage of the Kings, and the sound went thence to the Countrey, whence the silly Plebeians came presently in whole heards to this City, and strowting up and down the streets, had nothing in their mouths, but that the priviledg of Parlement, the priviledg of Parl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The King finding how violently the pulse of the gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The King departing, or rather being <hi>driven</hi> away thus from his two Houses, by this mutinous City, he might well at his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away have obraided her in the same words as <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. did upbraid <hi>Paris,</hi> who being by such another tumultuous rabble driven out of her in the time of the <hi>Ligue,</hi> as he was losing sight of her, he turn'd his face back, and sayed, <hi>Farewell ingratefull Cittie, I will never see thee again till I make my way into thee through thy Walls:</hi> Yet, though the King absented himself in person thus from the two Houses, he sent them frequent messages, that they wold draw into A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

The King being
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94588:15"/> kept thus out of one of his townes, might well suspect that he might be driven out of another, therefore 'twas time for him to look to the preservation of his Person, and the Countrey came in voluntarily unto him by thousands to that purpose, but hee made choice of a few only to be his gard, as the Parlement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers had don a good while before for themselfs: But now they went otherwise to worke, for they fell a levying, listing, and arming men by whole Regiments and Brigades till they had a verie considerable Army a foot, before the King had one Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteer or Trooper on his side: yet these men are so notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impudent, as to make the King the first Aggressor of the war, and to lay upon Him all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lood that was spilt to this day, wherein the Devill himself cannot be more shameles. The Parliamenteers having an army of foot and horse thus in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Equipage, 'twas high time for the King to look to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, therefore he was forced to display his royall Standard, and draw his sword quite out: Thus a cruell and most cruentous civill war began which lasted neer upon foure yeers without intermission, wherin there happen'd more battailes, sieges and skirmishes, then passed in the Netherlands in sourescore yeers, and herein the Englishmen may be said to get som credit abroad in the world, that they have the same blood running in their veines (though not the same braines in their sculls) which their Ancestors had, who were observed to be the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest peeple in the field, impatient of delay, and most desirous of battaile then any Nation.</p>
                  <p>But it was one of the greatest miracles that ever happen'd in this Land how the King was able to subsist so long against the Parlamenteers, considering the multiplicity of infinite advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they had of him by water and land: for they had the <hi>Scot,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> on their side; touching the first, he rushed in as an Auxiliary, with above 20000. Horse and Foot compleatly furnish'd both with small and great ammunition and arms, well cloth'd and money'd: For the second, they had all the Kings Ships well appointed, which are held to be the greatest security of the Island both for defence and offence, for every one of them is accounted one of the moving Castles of the Kingdome: besides they had all the other standing stone-Castles,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94588:16"/> Forts, and tenable places to boot: Concerning the last, (viz. the City) therein they had all the wealth, bravery, and prime ammunition of England, this being the onely Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin of men and money: Now if the King had had but one of these on his side, he had in all probability crush'd them to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: yet did he bear up strangely against them a long time, and might have don longer, had he kept the campane, and not spent the spirits of his men before Townes; had he not made a disadvantagious election of som Commanders in chief, and lastly, had he not had close <hi>Traitors</hi> within dores, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen <hi>Rebells</hi> without; for his very Cabinet Councell, and Bed-Chamber were not free of such vermin, and herein the Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteers spent unknown sums and were very prodigall of the Kingdomes money.</p>
                  <p>The King, after many traverses of war, being reduced to a great streight by crosse successes and Counsells, rather then to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the Parlementeers, withdrew himselfe in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingmans disguise to the Scors army, as his last randevous, and this plott was manag'd by the French Agent then residing here; A man wold think that that Nation wol'd have deem'd it an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall honor unto them to have their own King and Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man throw himself thus into their armes, and to repose such a singular trust in them upon such an Extremity: but they corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponded not so well with him as he expected, for though at first when the Parlamenteers sollicited their <hi>deer Brethren</hi> for a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Kings person unto them, their note was then, if any forren petty Prince had so put himself upon them, they could not with honor deliver him, much lesse their own Native King; yet they made a sacrifice of him at last for 800000. Crownes; whereupon <hi>Bellieure</hi> the French Ambassador being convoyed by a Troop of horse from the King towards London, to such a stand, in lieu of larges to the souldiers, he drew out an halfe crown peece, and asked them how many pence that was, they answered 30. <hi>He replied, for so much did Judas betray his Master, and so he departed</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, that in the cours of this Historicall Narration I have touch'd upon <hi>France,</hi> your Eminence may please to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that nothing allmost could tend more to the advantage of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94588:16"/> that King, then these commotions in England, considering that he was embark'd in an actuall war with the House of <hi>Austria</hi> and that this Iland did do <hi>Spain</hi> som good offices; among other, by transport of his treasure to Dunkerk in English bottomes, wherunto this King gave way, and somtimes in his own Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which sav'd the Spainard neer upon 20. in the hundred, then if he had sent it by way of Genoa; so that som think, though France made semblance to resent the sad condition of her Neighbour, and thereupon sent the Prince of <hi>Harcour,</hi> and the foresaid Monsieur <hi>Bellieure</hi> to compose matters, yet she never really intended it, as being against her present interest and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements: yet the world thinks it much that she shold pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely receive an Agent from these Parlamenteers, and that the French Nobility who were us'd to be the gallantest men in the world to vindicate the quarrels of distressed Ladies, are not more sensible of the outrages that have bin offer'd a daughter of France, specially of <hi>Henry the great's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to resume the threed of my Narration, the King (and with him, one may say, England also) being thus bought and sold, the Parlamenteers insteed of bringing him to Westminster, which had put a Period to all distempers toss'd him up and downe to private houses, and kept the former Army still afoot: And truly I think there was never Prince so abus'd, or poor pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple so baffled, and no peeple but a purblind besotted peeple wold have suffred themselfs to be so baffled: for notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that no Enemy appeer'd in any corner of the Kingdom, yet above 20000. Tagaroons have bin kept together ever since to grind the faces of the poore, and exhaust the very vitall spirits of town and Countrey, and keep them all in a perfect slavery: Had the Parlement-men, when the Scots were gone, brought their King in a generous and frank way (as had well becom'd Englishmen) to sitt among them, and trusted to him (which of necessity they must do at last) as they had gain'd more honor far in the world abroad, so they had gain'd more upon his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections then I beleeve they will ever do hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, the King having bin a good while prisoner to the Parlement, the Army snatch'd him away from them, and som of the chiefest Commanders having pawn'd their soules un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94588:17"/> him to restore him speedily, in lieu thereof they tumbled him up and down to sundry places, till they juggled him at last to that small Ile where now he is surrounded with a gard of strange faces and if happly he beginns to take delight in any of those faces, he is quickly taken out of his sight. These harsh usages hath made him becom all gray and oregrown with hair, so that he lookes rather like som Silvan Satyr then a Soverain Prince: And truly my Lord the meanest slave in St. <hi>Marks</hi> gallies or the abiects Captif in <hi>Algier</hi> bannier is not so miserable as he in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds, for <hi>they</hi> have the comfort of their wifes, children and frends, they can convey and receive Letters, send Messeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon their errands, and have privat discours with any; all which is denied to the King of great Britain, nay the young Princes his children are not permitted as much as to ask him blessing in a letter. In so much that if he were not a great King of his passions, and had a heart cast in an extraordinary Mould, these pressures &amp; those base aspersions that have bin publiquely cast upon him by the Parlement it self, had bin enough to have sent him out of the world e're this, and indeed 'tis the main th ng they drive at, to torture his brain, and tear his very heartstrings if they could: so that wheras this foolish ignorant peeple speak such horrid things of our <hi>Inquisition,</hi> truly my Lord 'tis a most gentle way of proceeding being compar'd to this Kings persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>As the King himselfe is thus in quality of a captif, so are all his Subjects becom perfect slaves, they have fool'd themselfs into a worse slavery then <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> under the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> for they know the bottom of their servitude by paying so many Sultanesses for every head; but here, peeple are put to endles, unknowne, tyrannicall Taxes, besides <hi>plundring</hi> and <hi>Accize,</hi> which two words, and the practise of them (with <hi>storming</hi> of Townes) they have learnt of their pure brethre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To speak a little more of the King, if all the infernall fiends had ligu'd against him, they could not have design d &amp; disgorg'd more malice: they wold have laid to his charge his fathers death, as arrand a lie as ever was hatch'd in hell: they wold make him fore-know the insurrection in Ireland, whereas the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador here, &amp; his Confessor who is a very reverend Irish man, told me, that he knew no more of it then the grand <hi>Mogor</hi> did: they charge him with all the bloud of this civill warre, wheras they and their instruments were the first kindlers of it, and that first prohibited trade: they intercepted and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his privat letters to his Queen, and hers to him, (Oh barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous basenesse!) but therin they did him a pleasure, though the intent was malitious, their aym in all things being to imbitter and envenom the hearts of his peeple towards him; and this was to render him a glorious and well-belov d Prince, and for making him rich, all which they had vow'd to do upon passing the Act of Continuance, they have made him poorer then the meanest of all his vassalls, they have made him to have no propriety in house, goods, or Lands, or as one may say, in his wife and children: 'Twas usuall for the father to hunt in his Park while the son hunted for his life in the field, for the wife to lye in his bedds, while the husband layed wait to

                  <p>Nor are they the honorablest sort of peeple, and men nobly extracted (as in Scotland) that do all this, (for then it were not so much to be wondred at) but they are the meanest sort of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, many of them Mechaniques, whereof the lower House is full; specially the subordinate Committees, who domineer more ore Nobles and Gentry, then the Parliament-Members themselfs their Masters.</p>
                  <p>Touching those few Peers that sit now voting in the upper House, they may be sayed to be but meer Cyphers, they are grown so degenerate as to suffer the <hi>Commons</hi> to give them the Law, to ride upon their backs, and do most things without them: There be many thousand Petitions that have been recommended by these Lords to the lower House, which are scornfully thrown into corners and never read; their Messengers have us'd to dance attendance divers houres and dayes afore they were vouchsafed to be let in or heard, to the eternall dishonor of those Peers, and yet poor spirited things they resent it not: The Commons now command all, and though, as I am inform'd, they are sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd thither by the Kings Originall Writt but to <hi>consent</hi> to what the King and his great Counsell of Peers (which is the true Court of Parlement) shall resolve upon; They are now from <hi>Consenters</hi> becom the chiefest <hi>Counsellors</hi> yea <hi>Controw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> of all; nay som of this lower House fly so high as to term themselfs <hi>Conquerors,</hi> and though in all conferences with the Lords they stand bare before them, yet by a new way of mix'd Committees they cary themselfs as <hi>Collegues:</hi> These are the men that now have the vogue, and they have made their Priviledges so big swoln, that they seem to have quite swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up both the Kings Prerogatives, and that of the Lords: These are the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

Thus, my Lord, is England now govern'd, so that 'tis an easy thing to take a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of her ruine; The Scot is now the rising man, who is the third time struck into her bowells with a numerous Army: They say he hath vow'd never to return till he hath put the Crown on the Kings head, the Scepter in his hand, and the sword by his side; if he do so, it will be the best thing that ever he did, though som think that he will never be able to do Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as much good as he hath don her hurt; He hath extremely outwitted the English of late yeers: And they who were the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of his first and last coming in, I hold to be the most pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enemies that ever this Nation had; for 'tis probable that <hi>Germany</hi> will be sooner free of the <hi>Swed,</hi> then <hi>England</hi> of the <hi>Scot,</hi> who will stick close unto him like a burr, that he cannot shake him off; He is becom allready Master of the Englishmans soul, by imposing a religion upon him, and he may hereafter be master of his body.</p>

Touching the second of these (I mean Bishops) they are grown so odious (principally for their large demeanes) among this peeple, as <hi>Monks</hi> were of old, and one may say it is a just judgment fallen upon them, for they were most busy in demolishing <hi>Convents</hi> and <hi>Monasteries,</hi> as these are in destroying <hi>Cathedralls</hi> and <hi>Ministers;</hi> But above all, it hath bin observ'd that this peeple hath bin a long time rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted towards the splendor of the Court, the very glory of their King, and the old establish'd Government of the land: 'Tis true there were a few small leakes sprung in the great ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the State, (and what vessell was ever so tite but was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to leakes?) but these wiseakers in stopping of one have made a hundred: Yet if this Kings raign were parallell'd to that of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's,</hi> who was the greatest Minion of a peeple that ever was, one will find that she stretch'd the Prerogative as much: In her time as I have read in the Latin Legend of her life, som had their hands cut off for writing against her matching with the Duke of <hi>Aniou,</hi> others were hang'd at Tyburn for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing her government; she pardon'd thrice as many Roman Priests as this King did, she pass'd divers Monopolies, she kept an Agent at Rome, she sent her Sargeant at Armes to pluck out a Member then sitting in the House of Commons by the eares, and clap'd him in prison; she call'd them sawcy fellowes to meddle with her <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or with the government of her houshold, she mannag'd all forren affaires, specially the warrs with <hi>Ireland</hi> soly by her privy Counsell; yet there was no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring at her raign, and the reason I conceave to be, that there was neither Scot or Puritan had then any stroke in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>Touching the other grand Idoll the <hi>Parlement,</hi> 'tis true that

                  <p>Yet though this institution of Parlement be a wholsom thing in it self, there is in my judgment a great incongruity in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and I believe it hath bin the cause of most distempers; It is, That the <hi>Burgesses</hi> are more in number then the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Shires;</hi> for the <hi>Knights</hi> of the <hi>Shires</hi> are commonly Gentlemen well born, and bred, and vers'd in the Lawes of the Land, as well as forren governments, divers of them; but the <hi>Burgesses</hi> of Townes are commonly Tradesmen, and being bred in Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, they are most of them inclining to Puritamism, and consequently to popular government; these, exceeding the <hi>Knights</hi> in number, carry all before them by plurality of Voices, and so puzzle all: And now that I have mentioned <hi>Corporations,</hi> I must tell your Lordship, that the greatest soloecism in the policy of this Kingdom, is the number of them; especially this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous City, which is compos'd of nothing els but of <hi>Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and the greatest errors that this King, specially his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther committed, was to suffer this town to spread her wings so wide; for she bears no proportion with the bignesse of the Iland, but may fit a Kingdom thrice as spacious; she engrosseth and dreines all the wealth and strength of the Kingdom; so that I cannot compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To draw to a conclusion, This Nation is in a most sad and desperate condition, that they deserved to be pittied, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from sinking, and having cast the present state of things and all interests into an equall balance, I find, my Lord there be three waies to do it, one good, and two bad:</p>

                  <head>A Winter Dream.</head>
                  <p>IT was in the dead of a long Winter night, when no eyes were open but Watchmen, and Centinell's, that I was fallen soundly asleep, the Cinq out-Ports were shut up closer then usually, and my sences so treble lock'd, that the Moon, had she descended from her watry Orb, might have don much more to me then she did to <hi>Endymion</hi> when he lay snoaring upon the brow of <hi>Latmus</hi> Hill; nay, (be it spoken without prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) if a rib had bin taken out of me that night, to have made a new model of a woman, I shold hardly have felt it.</p>
                  <p>Yet, though the Cousin-german of Death had so strongly seiz'd thus upon the exterior parts of this poore Tabernacle of flesh, my inward were never more actif, and fuller of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then they were that night.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Me thought my soul made a sallie abroad into the world, and fetch'd a vast compas; she seem'd to soar up and slice the air, to crosse seas, clammer up huge Hills, and never rested till she had arriv'd at the <hi>Antipodes:</hi> Now som of the most judicious Geometricians and Chorographers hold that the whole Masse of the Earth being round like the rest of her fellow Elements, ther be places, and poizing parts of the Continent, there be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94588:25"/> Peninsulas, Promontories and Ilands upon the other face of the Earth that correspond and concenter with all those Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Iles that are upon this superficies which we tread; Countries that symbolize with them in qualities, in tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of air and clime, as well as in nature of soile; The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants also of those places which are so perpendicularly opposit, do sympathize one with another in disposition, complexions and humors, though the Astronomers wold have their East to be our West, and so all things <hi>vice versa</hi> in point of position, which division of the Heaven is only mans institution.</p>
                  <p>But to give an account of the strange progres my soule made that night; the first Country she lighted on was a very low flat Countrey, and it was such an odd amphibious Countrey, being so indented up and down with Rivers and armes of the sea, that I made a question whither I shold call it Water or Land; yet though the <hi>Sea</hi> be invited and usher'd in into som places, he is churlistly pen'd out in som other: so that though he foam and swell, and appeer as high Walls hard by, yet they keep him out, maugre all his roaring and swelling.</p>
                  <p>As I wandred up and down in this Watry Region, I might behold from a streight long Dike whereon I stood, a strange kind of Forrest, for the trees mov'd up and down; they look'd afar off as if they had bin blasted by thunder; for they had no leafs at all; but making a neerer approach unto them, I found they were a nomberlesse company of Ship Masts, and before them appeer'd a great Town incorporated up and down with Water;<note place="margin">Amsterdam.</note> As I mus'd with my self upon the sight of all this, I concluded, that the Inhabitants of that Countrey were notable industrious peeple, who could give Law so to the angry <hi>Ocean,</hi> and occupie those places where the great <hi>Leviathan</hi> should tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and take his pastime in; As my thought ran thus, I met with a man, whom I conjectur'd to be 'twixt a Marchant and a Mariner, his salutation was so homely; the air also was so foggie that me thought it stuck like cobbwebs in his Mustachos; &amp; he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94588:25"/> was so dull in point of motion, as if his veines had bin filld with buttermilk in lieu of blood: I began to mingle words with him, and to expostulate somthing about that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and peeple; and then I found a great deal of downright ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities in him: He told me that <hi>They</hi> were the only men who did miracles of late yeers; Those innumerable piles of stones you see before you in such comely neat fabriques, is a place (said he) that from a Fish <hi>Market</hi> in effect is com to be one of the greatest <hi>Marts</hi> in this part of the world, which hath made her swell thrice bigger then she was 50. yeers ago; and as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this floating Forrest of Masts before her mole, so if you could see the foundations of her houses, you shold see another great Forrest, being rear'd from under ground upon fair piles of timber, which if they chance to sink in this Marshy soyl, we have an art to scrue them up again. We have for 70. yeers and above without any intermission, except a short-liv'd truce that once was made, wrastled with one of the greatest Potentates up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and born up stoutly against him, gramercy our two next neighbour Kings, and their <hi>Reason of State,</hi> with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our situation. We have <hi>fought</hi> our selfs into a free State, and now quite out of that ancient alleageance we ow'd him; and though we pay 20. times more in taxes of all sorts then we did to him, yet we are contented: We have turn'd <hi>War</hi> into a <hi>trade,</hi> and that which useth to <hi>beggar</hi> others, hath <hi>benefited</hi> us: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, we have bin and are still the rendevous of most disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Subjects, when by the motions of unquiet consciences in points of Religion, or by the fury of the sword, they are forc'd to quit their own Countreys, who bring their arts of Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and moveables, hither; In so much that our Lombards are full of their goods, and our banks superabound with their <hi>gold</hi> and silver which they bring hither in <hi>specie.</hi> To secure our selfs, and cut the Enemy more work, and to engage our Confiderats in a war with him, we have kindled fires in evry corner; and now that they are together by the Eares, we have bin content
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94588:26"/> lately, being long woo'd thereunto, to make a peace with that King to whom we once acknowledged vassalage; which King out of a height of spirit, hath spent 500. times more upon us for our reduction, then all our Countrey is worth; But now he hath bin well contented to renounce and abjure all claimes and rights of Soverainty over us; In so much, that being now without an Enemy, we hope in a short time to be masters of all the comerce in this part of the world, and to eat our Neighbours out of trade in their own Comodities: We fear nothing but that exces of Wealth, and a surfet of ease may make us careles and breed quarrells among our selfs, and that our Generall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing married to a great Kings daughter, mayâ</p>
                  <p>Here he suddenly broke the threed of his discourse, and got hastily away, being hal'd by a ship that was sailing hard by.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon my soul took wing again, and cut her way through that foggy condens'd aire, till she lighted on a fair, spacious, cleare Continent, a generous and rich Soile mantled up and downe with large woods, where, as I rang'd to and fro, I might see divers faire Houses, Townes, Palaces and Castles, looking like so many <hi>Carkases,</hi> for no humane soule appear'd in them; me thought I felt my heart melting within me in a soft resentment of the case of so gallant a Countrey, and as I stood at amaze, and in a kind of astonishment, a goodly perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage makes towards me, whom both for his comportment, and countenance, I perceiv'd to be of a finer mould then that companion I had met withall before: by the trace of his looks I guessed he might be som Nobleman that had bin ruin'd by som disaster: having acosted him with a fitting distance, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in a Masculin strong winded language full of aspirations and tough collision of Consonants, to tell me as followeth: Sir, I find you are a stranger in this Countrey, because you stand so agast at the devastations of such a fair piece of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, then know Sir, because I beleeve you are curious to carry away with you the causes thereof, that those ruthfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94588:26"/> which you behold, are the effects of a long lingring war, and of the fury of the Sword, a cruentous civill War that hath rag'd here ubove 30. yeares: one of the grounds of it was the infortunate undertaking of a Prince, who liv'd not far off in an affluence of all earthly felicity; he had the greatest Lady to his wife, the best purse of money, the fairest Stable of horse, and choicest Library of books of any other of his neighbour Princes. But being by desperate and aspiring coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells put upon a Kingdome, while he was catching at the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Crowne, he lost the substance of all his own ancient possessions: by the many powerfull alliances he had (which was the cause he was pitched upon) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thence my soule taking her flight o're divers huge and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid cacuminous mountaines, at last I found my selfe in a great populous Towne, but her buildings were miserably battered up and downe, she had a world of Palaces, Castles, Convents and goodly Churches: as I stepped out of curiosity into one of them, upon the West side there was a huge Grate, where a creature all in white beckned at me, making my app oach to the Grate, I found her to be a Nun, a lovely creature she was, for I could not distinguish which was whiter, her <hi>hue</hi> or her
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94588:27"/>
                     <hi>habit,</hi> her vaile other face, it made me remember (though in a dream my self) that saying, <hi>If Dreams and wishes had been tru, there had not been found a tru maid to make a Nun of ever since a Cloyster'd life began first among women;</hi> I asked her the reason how so many ugly devastations should befall so beautifull a City, she in a dolorous gentle tone, and ruthfull accents, the tears trickling down her cheeks like so many pearles, (such pearly teares that wold have dissolv'd a Diamond) sobb'd out unto me this speech: Gentle Sir, 'tis far beyond any expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mine, and indeed beyond humane imagination to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the late calamities which have befallen this faire though infortunate City, a pernicious popular Rebellion broke out here upon a sudden into most horrid barbarismes, a Fate that hangs over most rich popular places that swim in luxe and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but touching the grounds thereof, one may say that rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion entred into this City, as sin first entred into the world by an <hi>apple:</hi> For our King now in his great extremities having almost halfe the world banding against him, and putting but a small tax upon a basket of fruit to last only for a time, this <hi>fruit-tax</hi> did put the peeples teeth so on edge, that it made them gnash against the Government, and rush into Armes; but they are sensible now of their own follies, for I thinke never any place suffered more in so short a time: the civill combustions abroad in other Kingdomes may be said to be but small squibs compar'd to those horrid flakes of fire which have rag'd here, and much adoe we had to keep our <hi>Vestall fire</hi> free from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it: in lesse then the revolution of a yeer it consum'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fourscore thousand soules within the walls of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; But 'tis not the first time of forty, that this luxurious foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish peeple hath smarted for their insurrections and insolencies, and that this mad <hi>horse</hi> hath o'rethrowne his Rider, and drawn a worse upon his back; who instead of a saddle, put a pack-saddle and Panniers upon him: but indeed the voluptuousnesse of this peeple was growne ripe for the judgement of heaven;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94588:27"/> she was then beginning to expostulat with me about the state of my Countrey, and I had a mighty mind to satisfie her, for I could have corresponded with her in the relation of as strange things, but the Lady <hi>Ahadesse</hi> calling her away, she departed in an instant, obedience seem'd to be there so precise and punctuall.</p>
                  <p>I steer'd my course thence through a most delicious Countrey to another City that lay in the very bosome of the Sea, she was at first nothing els but a kind of posie made up of dainty green hillocks, tied together by above 400. bridges, and so coagulated into a curious Citie; though she be espous'd to <hi>Neptune</hi> very solemnly once evry yeer, yet she still reserves her maydenhead, and beares the title of the <hi>Virgin Citie</hi> in that part of the world; But I found her tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mainly with a huge Giant that wold ravish her; He hath shrewdly set on her skirts, and a great shame it is, that she is not now assisted by her Neighbours, &amp; that they shold be together by the eares when they shold do so necessary a work, considering how that great Giant is their common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; and hath lately vow'd <hi>seven yeers</hi> warrs against her; specially considering, that if he comes once to <hi>ravish</hi> her, he will quickly <hi>ruin</hi> them; She (to her high honor be it spoken) being their only rampart against the incursion of the said Giant, and by consequence their greatest security.</p>
                  <p>From this <hi>Maiden</hi> Citie, mee thought, I was in a trice carried over a long gulf, and so through a Midland Sea, into another Kingdome, where I felt the Clime hotter by some Degrees; a rough hew'n soile, for the most part, it was, full of craggie barren <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ills; but where there were valleys and water enough, the coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>rey was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily fruitfull, whereby nature (it seems) made her a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation for the sterility of the rest. Yet notwithstanding the hardship of the soyl, I found her full of Abbeys, Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, Hermitages, Convents, Churches, and other places of devotion; As I rov'd there a while, I encountred a grave
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94588:28"/> man in a long black cloak, by the fashion whereof, and by the brimms of his hat, I perceived him to be a Jesuit; I clos'd with him, and question'd with him about that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: He told me the King of that Countrey was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Potentat of that part of the world; and, to draw power to a greater unitie, they of our <hi>Order</hi> could be well conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he were universall Head over Temporalls, because 'tis most probable to be effected by him, as we have already one universall Head over Spiritualls: This is the Monark of the Mines, I mean of Gold and Silver, who furnishes all the world, but most of all his own Enemies with money, which money foments all the warrs in this part of the world: Never did any earthly Monark thrive so much in so short a tract of time; But of late yeers he hath bin illfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly shaken by the revolt and utter defection of two sorts of Subjects, who are now in actuall armes against him on both sides of him at his own doors. There hath bin also a long deadly feud 'twixt the next tramontan Kingdom and him, though the Queen that rules there be his own sister, an unnaturall odious thing: But it seems God Almighty hath a quarrell of late yeers with all earthly Potentats; for in so short a time there never happen'd such strange shocks and revolutions: The great Emperour of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> hath bin outed, he and all his children by a petty companion: The King of <hi>China</hi> a greater Emperour then he, hath lost almost all that huge Monarchy by the incursion of the <hi>Tartar,</hi> who broke ore the Wall upon him; The grand <hi>Turk</hi> hath bin strangled, with 30. of his Concubines; The Emperur of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi> hath bin content to beg his life of his own vassalls, &amp; to see before his face divers of his chief Officers hack'd to pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; their heads cut off &amp; steep'd in strong water, to make them burn more bright in the market place. Besides theabove mentioned, this King hath also divers Enemies more, yet he bears up against them all indifferently well, though with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94588:28"/> infinite expence of treasure: and the Church, specially our Society, hath stuck close unto him in these his exigents: whence may be inferr'd, that let men repine as long as they will at the possessions of the Church, <hi>they are the best anchors to a State in a storme,</hi> and in time of need to preserve it from sinking; besides acts of charity wold be quite lost among men, did not the wealth of the Church keep life in them: Hereupon drawing a huge paire of Beads from under his cloak, he began to aske me of my Religion; I told him I had a long journey to go, so that I could not stay to wait on him longer; so we parted, and me thought I was very glad, to be rid of him so well.</p>
                  <p>My soule then made another flight over an Assembly of hideous high hills, and lighted under another Clyme, on a rich and copious Countrey resembling the form of a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senge, but me thought, I never saw so many poor peeple in my life; I encountred a Peasan, and asked him what the reason was, that there shold be so much poverty in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where there was so much plenty: Sir, they keep the Commonalty poor in pure policy here; for being a peeple, as the world observes us to be, that are more humerous then others, and that love variety and change, if we were suffered to be pamper'd with wealth, we wold ever and anon rise up in tumults, and so this Kingdome shold never be quiet, but subject to intestine broyles, and so to the hazard of any invasion: But there was of late a devillish Cardinall, whose <hi>humour</hi> being as sanguin as his <hi>habit,</hi> and working upon the weaknes of his Master, hath made us not onely poore, but stark beggars, and we are like to continue so by an eternall war, wherein he hath plung'd this poore Kingdom, which war must be maintained with our very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall spirits: but as dejected and indigent as we are, yet upon the death of that ambitious Cardinall, we had risen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this, who hath the Vogue now, (with whom he hath
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94588:29"/> left his principles) had not the fearfull example of our next transmarin Western neighbours, and the knowledge we have of a worse kind of slavery, of those endles arbitrary taxes, and horrid confusions they have fool'd themselfs lately into, utterly deterr'd us, though we have twenty times more reason to rise then ever they had: yet our great City hath shew'd her teeth, and gnash'd them ilfavouredly of late, but we find she hath drawn water only for her owne Mill, we fare little the better, yet we hope it will conduce to peace, which hath been so long in agitation. I cannot remember how I parted with that Peasan, but in an instant I was landed upon a large Island, and me thought, 'twas the temperat'st Region I had been in all the while; the <hi>heat</hi> of the Sun there is as harmles as his <hi>light,</hi> the evening <hi>serenes</hi> are as wholsome there, as the morning <hi>dew;</hi> the <hi>Dog-daies</hi> as innocuous as any of the two <hi>Equinoxes.</hi> As I rang'd to and fro that fair Iland, I spied a huge City whose length did far exceed her latitude, but neither for length or latitude did she seem to beare any politicall proportion with that Iland: she look'd, me thought, like the Jesuits hat whom I had met withall before, whose brimms were bigger then the crowne, or like a petticoat, whose fringe was longer then the body. As I did cast my eyes upwards, me thought I discern'd a strange Inscription in the aire which hung just over the midst of that Citie written in such huge visible characters, that any one might have read it, which was this: <hi>Woe be to the bloody City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon a reverend Bishop presented himselfe to my view, his gray haires, and grave aspect struck in mee an extraordinary reverence of him: so performing those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements which were fitting, I asked him of the condition of the place, he in a submisse sad tone, with clouds of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy waving up and downe his lookes, told me; Sir, this Iland was reputed few years since to have been in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94588:29"/> completest condition of happinesse of any part on earth, insomuch that she was repin'd at for her prosperity and peace by all her neighbours, who were plung'd in warre round about her, but now she is fallen into as deep a gulf of misery, and servitude, as she was in a height of felicity and freedom before: Touching the grounds of this change, I cannot impute it to any other then to a surfet of happinesse; now <hi>there is no surfet so dangerous as that of happines:</hi> There are such horrid divisions here, that if they were a foot in hell, they were able to destroy the Kingdom of Satan: truly Sir, there are crep'd in more opinions among us about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, then the Pagans had of old of the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> which <hi>Varro</hi> saith were 300. the understandings of poor men were never so puzzled &amp; distracted; a great while there were two opposit powers who swayed here in a kind of equality that people knew not whom to obey, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands complied with both, as the men of <hi>Calecut</hi> who adore God and the Devill, (<hi>Tamum Squantum,</hi> as it is in the Indian language) the one for love, the other for feare: there is a monstrous kind of wild liberty here that ever was upon earth; that which was complained of as a stalking horse to draw on our miseries at first, is now only in practice, which is meer <hi>arbitrary rule;</hi> for now both <hi>Law, Religion,</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> are here arbitrary: Touching the last, 'tis quite lost, 'tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that any one may prate, preach, or print what they will in derogation of their anointed King: which word <hi>King</hi> was once a Monosyllable of some weight in this Ile, but 'tis as little regarded now as the word <hi>Pope</hi> (among som) which was also a mighty Monosyllable once among us: the rule of the Law is, that the King can <hi>do</hi> no wrong, there is a contrary rule now crept in, that the King can <hi>receive</hi> no wrong; and truly Sir, 'tis a great judgement both upon Prince and peeple, upon the one, that the love of his vassalls shold be so alienated from him; upon the other, that their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94588:30"/> hearts shold be so poysond, and certainly 'tis the effects of an ill spirit; both the one and the other in all probability tend to the ruine of this Kingdom. I will illustrat this unto you, Sir, by an Apologue as followeth.</p>
                  <p>There happen'd a shrewd commotion &amp; distemper in the Body Natural 'twixt the <hi>Head</hi> and the <hi>Members;</hi> not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Noble</hi> parts (som of them) but the common inferior organs also banded against him in a high way of unnaturall presumption; The heart, which is the source of life, with the <hi>PericardiÅ«</hi> about it, did swell against him; the <hi>Liver,</hi> which is the shop of sanguification, gather'd ill blood: all the humors turn'd to <hi>Choler</hi> against him; The Arms lift up themselfs against him, neither back, hams or knees wold bow to him, nay the very feet offer'd to kick him; The foure and twenty ribs, the reines, the <hi>Hypocondrium,</hi> the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> the <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raic,</hi> &amp; <hi>Emulgent</hi> veins were fil'd with corrupt blood against him: yea the <hi>Hypogastrium</hi> and the bowells made an <hi>intestin</hi> war against him. While the feud lasted, it hapned that these tumultuary Members fell out among themselfs; The <hi>Hand</hi> wold have all the fingers equall, nay the <hi>toes</hi> wold be of even length, &amp; the rest of the subservient members wold be independent: They grew so foolish, that they wold have the <hi>fondament</hi> to be where the <hi>mouth</hi> is, the <hi>brest</hi> where the <hi>bask,</hi> the <hi>belly</hi> where the <hi>braine,</hi> and the <hi>yard</hi> where the <hi>nose,</hi> the <hi>sholders</hi> shold be no more said to be backwards, nor the <hi>leggs</hi> downwards; A bloody quarrell fell 'twixt the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Liver,</hi> which of them receiv'd the first formation, and whither of the two be the chiefest officine of sanguificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which question bred so much <hi>gaul</hi> 'twixt the <hi>Aristotelians</hi> &amp; the <hi>Galenists;</hi> While this <hi>Spleen</hi> &amp; strange <hi>tympany</hi> of pride lasted, it cau'sd such an ebullition and heat in the masse of <hi>bloud,</hi> that it put the Microcosm, the whole Body in a high burning Feaver or Frenzy rather, which in a very short time grew to be a <hi>Heptic,</hi> and so all perish'd by a fatall consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94588:30"/>
                  <p>I fear the same fate attends this infortunate Iland, for such as was the condition of that naturall head, this Apolog speaks of, the same is the case of the politic Head and Body of this Iland; Never was Soverain Prince so banded against by his own Subjects, never was the patience of a Prince so put upon the tenter; He is still no lesse then a Captif, his children are in banishment in one Countrey, his Queen in another, the greatest Queen of bloud upon earth; a Queen that brought with her the greatest portion that ever Queen did in treasure; yet in twenty yeers and upwards, her join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath not bin setled as it shold be; nor hath she bin crown'd all this while according to matrimoniall Articles; notwithstanding that, for the comfort of this Nation, and the establishment of the Throne, she hath brought forth so many hopefull Princes.</p>
                  <p>But now Sir; because I see you are so attentive, and seem to be much mov'd at this Discourse, as I have discover'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the generall cause of our calamities, which was not onely a satiety, but a surfeit of happinesse, so I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend now to a more particular cause of them; it was a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nation that brought these cataracts of mischief: upon us; and you know the old saying,
<q>
                        <l>Out of the North</l>
                        <l>All ill comes forth.</l>
                     </q> Far be it from me to charge the whole Nation herewith; no, but onely some pernicions Instruments that had insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated themselfs, and incorporated among us, and sway'd both in our Court and Counsells: They had a hand in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Monopoly; they had out of our Exchequer, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms neer upon 400000. Crowns in yeerly Pensions, <hi>viis &amp; modis;</hi> yet they could not be content, but they must puzzle the peace and policy of this Church and State: and though they are people of differing Intellectualls, differing Lawes, Customes, and Manners unto us, yet for matter of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94588:31"/> they wold bring our necks into their yoak, as if they had a greater talent of reason, &amp; cleerer illuminations, as if they understood Scripture better, and were better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God Almighty then we, who brought them first from Paganisme to Christianity, and also to be reformed Christians: but it seems, matters have little thriven with them; nay the visible hand of heaven hath bin heavily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them divers wayes since they did lift <hi>their</hi> hands against their <hi>native King;</hi> For notwithstanding the vast summs they had hence, yet is the generality of them as beggarly as ever they were; besides, the Civill Sword hath rag'd there as furiously as here, and did as much execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Moreover the Pestilence hath beene more violent, and sweeping in their chief Town then ever it was since they were a peeple. And now lately ther's the notablest dishonour befaln them that possibly could light upon a Nation, in that 7000. of ours shold upon eeven ground encounter, kill, slay, rout and utterly discomfit thrice as many of theirs, though as well appointed and arm'd as men could be: And truly Sir, the advantages that accru to this Nation are not a few by that exploit; For of late yeers that Nation was cried up abroad to be a more Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall peeple then we, and to have baffled us in open field in divers traverses: besides, I hope a small matter will pay now their Arrerages here, and elswhere; but principally, I hope they will not be so busie hereafter in our Court and Counsell, as they have been formerly.</p>
                  <p>Another cause of our calamity is a strange race of peeple sprung up among our selfs, who were confederat with those of the North; they wold make Gods House cleane, and put out the candle of all ancient learning &amp; knowledg; they would sweep it only by the light of an <hi>Ignis fatuus:</hi> but 'tis visibly found that they have brought much more rubbage into it; and wheras in reforming this house, they shold ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther find out the <hi>groat</hi> that is lost, they go about to take away
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94588:31"/> the <hi>mite</hi> that's left, and so put <hi>Christs</hi> Spouse to live on meer almes: true it is, there is a kind of <hi>Zeal</hi> that burns in them, (&amp; I could wish there were so much <hi>piety</hi>) but this zeal burns with too much violence and presumption, which is no good symptom of spirituall health, it being a rule, that as the naturall heat, so the spirituall shold be moderat, els it commonly turns to a frenzy: and that is the thing which causeth such a giddines and distraction in their braines; This (proceeding from the suggestions of an ill spirit) puffs them up with so much mentall pride; for the Devill is so cunning a Wrastler, that he oftentimes lifts men up to give them the greater fall: they think they have an inerring spirit, and that their <hi>Diall</hi> must needs go tru, howsoever the Sun goes: they wold make the <hi>Gospell,</hi> as the <hi>Caddies</hi> make the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> to decide all civill temporall matters under the large notion of <hi>slander,</hi> whereof <hi>they</hi> to be the Judges, and so in time to hook in all things to their <hi>Classis:</hi> I believe if these men were dissected when they are dead, there would be a great deale of Quick-silver found in their braines.</p>

                  <p>To conclude Sir, the glory of this Isle is quite blasted; 'tis tru they speake of peace, but <hi>while the King speakes to them of it, they make themselfs ready for battell;</hi> I much fear, that <hi>Ixion</hi>-like, we imbrace a cloud for peace, out of which ther will issue out <hi>Centaures,</hi> and <hi>Monsters,</hi> as sprung out of that cloud.</p>
                  <p>Touching that ancient'st holy <hi>Order</hi> whereof you see me to be; I well hoped, that in regard they pretended to <hi>reform</hi> things only, they wold not have quite extirpated, but <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi> only this <hi>Order:</hi> it had bin enough to <hi>brayle</hi> our wings, not to have fear'd them: to have lopp'd &amp; prun'd, not to have destroid root &amp; branch of that ancient tree which was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the hands of the Apostles themselfs: In fine Sir, we are a lost peeple, 'tis no other <hi>Daedalus,</hi> but the high D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Truly Sir, as my tongue is too feeble to expresse our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94588:32"/> so the plummet of the best understanding is too short to sadom the depth of them.</p>
                  <p>With this, the grave Venerable Bishop giving me his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction, fetcht such a sigh, that wold have rended a rock asunder; and suddenly vanish'd (me thought) out of my sight up towards Heaven. I presently after awoke about the dawnings of the day, when one could hardly discern Dog from Wolf; and my soule, my <hi>Animulae vagula blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dula,</hi> being re-entred through the Horn gate of sleep into her former mansion, half tyr'd after so long a Peregrination; and having rub'd my eyes, distended my limms, and return'd to a full expergefaction, I began to call my self to account touching those world of objects my fancy had represented unto me that night; and when by way of reminisence I fell to examine and ruminate upon them; Lord, what a masse of <hi>Ideas</hi> ran in my head! but when I call'd to mind the last Countrey my soule wandred in, me thought I felt my heart like a lump of lead within me, when I considerd how pat every circumstance might be applied to the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>England:</hi> I was meditating with my self what kind of dream this might be; whereupon I thought upon the common division that Philosophers make of dreames, that they are either

                  </p>
                  <p>For the first, they are <hi>Visions</hi> more properly or <hi>Revelations,</hi> whereof there are divers examples in the holy Oracles of God, but the puddled cranies of my brain are not roomes clean enough to entertain such: Touching the second kind, which com by the impulses of the Devill, I have heard of divers of them, as when one did rise up out of his sleep, and fetcht a poyniard to stab his bedfellow, which he had don,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94588:33"/> had he not bin awake; Another went to the next chamber abed to his mother, and wold have ravish'd her; but I thank God this dream of mine was not of that kind? Touching the third species of dreames; which are <hi>naturall</hi> dreames, they are according to the humor which predominats; if Melancholy sway, we dream of black darksom devious pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; if Phlegm, of waters; if Choler, of frayes, fightings and troubles; if Sanguin predominat, we dream of green fields, gardens, and other pleasant representations; and the Physitian comes often to know the quality of a disease by the nocturnall objects of the patients fancy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Humane</hi> dreams relate to the actions of the day past, or of the day following, &amp; som representations are clear &amp; even; others are amphibious, mongrell, distorted and squalid ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, according to the species of things in troubled matters; and the object is cleer or otherwise, according to the tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or the grossnes of the vapors which ascend from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle up to the brain.</p>
                  <p>Touching my dream, I think it was of this last kind; for I was discoursing of, and condoling the sad distempers of our times the day before: I pray God som part of it prove not propheticall; for, although the Frenchman sayeth, <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges sont Mensonges,</hi> dreames are delusions, and that they turn to contraries, yet the Spaniard hath a saying,

                     </q> Insomuch that some Dreams oftentimes prove tru; as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> makes mention of a rich Merchant in <hi>Milan,</hi> who being dead, one of his Creditors comes to his son to demand such a sum of money which he had lent his father; the son was confident 'twas paid, but not finding the Creditors Receipt, he was impleaded and like to be cast in the Sute, had not his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94588:33"/> fathers Ghost appeared to him, and directed him to the place where the Acquittance was, which he found the next day accordingly. <hi>Galen</hi> speaks of one that dreamt he had a wooden leg, and the next day he was taken with a dead Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in one whole side. Such a Dream was that of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> when he thought he had felt a cold gust passing through his bowells; and the next day he was slain in the guts, by the glance of an arrow, in new Forrest, a place where he and his Father had committed so many Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. I have read in <hi>Artimedorus,</hi> of a woman that dreamt she had seen the pictures of three faces in the Moone like her self, and she was brought to bed of three daughters a little after, who all died within the compas of a moneth. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dreamt, that <hi>Xanthus</hi> water ran red, and the next day he fell a spitting of blood.</p>
                  <p>To this I will add another fore-telling Dream, whereof I have read, which was thus: two young Gentlemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing travelling abroad in strange Countreyes, and being come to a great towne, the one lay far in the Citie, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in an Hostry without the walls in the Suburbs: he in the City did dream in the dead of night, that his friend which he had left in the Suburbs rush'd into his chamber panting and blowing, being pursued by others; he dreamt so againe, and the third time he might see his friends Ghost appeering at his beds side with blood trickling down his throat, and a Poyniard in his brest, telling him; Dear friend, I am come now to take my last farewell of thee, and if thou rise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, thou shalt meet me in the way going to be buried; the next morning his friend going with his Host towards the Inn in the Suburbs where he left his friend, they met with a Cart laden with dung in the way, which being staid and search'd, the dead body was found naked in the dung.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude with a notable Dreame that <hi>Osman</hi> the great Turk had, not many yeers since, a few dayes before he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94588:34"/> was murthered by his Janizaries, 1623. He dreamt, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mounted upon a huge Camell, he could not make him go, though he switch'd and spur'd him never so much; at last the Camell overthrew him, and being upon the ground, onely the bridle was left in his hand, but the body of the Camell was vanished: the <hi>Mufti</hi> not being illuminated e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to interpret this Dream, a <hi>Santon</hi> who was a kind of Idiot, told him, the Camell represented the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> which he not being able to govern, he should be o'erthrown, which two dayes after proved tru.</p>
                  <p>By these, and a cloud of examples more, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Dreams are not altogether impertinent, but som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be gathered out of them; though the application and meaning of them be denied to man, unlesse by speciall illumination.</p>

                  <p>THis Letter requires no Apologie, much lesse any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but may expect rather a good receprion, and thanks, when your Lordship hath seriously perused the contents, and ruminated well upon the matter it treats of, with your second and third thoughts, which usually carry with them a greater advantage of wisedome: It concernes not your body, or temporall estate, but things reflecting upon the noblest part of you, your soule, which being a beame of Immortality, and a type of the Almighty, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more precious, and rendreth all other earthly things to be but bables and transitory trifles. Now, the strongest tye, the solemnest engagement and stipulation that can be betwixt the soule and her Creator, is an <hi>Oath.</hi> I doe not understand common tumultuary rash oaths, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an ill habit, or heat of passion upon sudden contingencies, for such oaths bind one to nought else but to repentance: No, I mean serious and legall oaths, taken with a calm prepared spirit, either for the asserting of truth, and conviction of falshood, or for fidelitie in the execution of some Office, or binding to civill obedience and Loyaltie, which is one of the essentiall parts of a Christian. Such publick oaths legally made with the Royall assent of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
<pb facs="tcp:94588:37"/> from whom they receive both legalitie and life, else they are invalid &amp; unwarrantable, as they are religious acts in their own nature, so is the taking and observance of them part of Gods honor, &amp; there can be nothing more derogatory to the high Majesty and holinesse of his name, nothing more dangerous, destructive &amp; damnable to humane souls then the infringment and eluding of them, or omission in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them. Which makes the <hi>Turks,</hi> of whom Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in this particular may learn a tender peece of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to be so cautious, that they seldom or never administer an oath to Greek, Jew, or any other Nation, and the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>son is, that if the Party sworn doth take that Oath upon hopes of some advantage, or for evading of danger and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and afterwards rescinds it, they think themselves to be involved in the Perjurie, and accessary to his damnation: Our Civill Law hath a Canon consonant to this, which is, <hi>Mortale peccatum est ei prastare juramentum, quem scio veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similiter violaturum; 'Tis a mortall sin to administer an Oath to him who I probably know will break it;</hi> To this may allude ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholesome saying, <hi>A false Oath is damnable, a true Oath dangerous, none at all the safest.</hi> How much then have they to answer for, who of late years have fram'd such for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable coercive generall Oaths to serve them for engins of State to lay battery to the Consciences and Soules of poore men, and those without the assent of the Soveraign, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed point blank to former Oaths they themselves had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: these kind of Oaths the City hath swallowed lately in grosse, and the Country in detaile, which makes me confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beleeve that if ever that saying of the holy Prophet, <hi>The Land mournes for Oaths,</hi> was appliable to any part of the habitable earth, it maybe now aplied to this desperate Island.</p>
                  <p>But now I come to the maine of my purpose, and to those Oaths your Lordship hath taken before this distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb facs="tcp:94588:37"/> time, which, the world knowes, and your conscience can testifie, were divers; They were all of them Solemn, and some of them Sacramentall Oaths (and indeed, every <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi> Oath <hi>among the Ancients was held a Sacrament:</hi>) They all implyed, and imposed an indispensible fidelity, Truth and loyalty from you to your Soveraigne Prince, your Liege Lord and Master the King: I will make some instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Your Lordship tooke an Oath when Knight of the Bath <hi>to love your Soveraigne above all earthly Creatures, and for His Right and dignity to live and die:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the Oath of Supremacy you swear <hi>to beare faith and true allegeance to the Kings Highnesse, and to your power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all Iurisdictions, Privileges, Preheminences and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging to His Highnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Lordship took an Oath when Privie Counsellor, <hi>to be a true and faithfull Servant unto Him, and if you knew or understood of any manner of thing to be attempted, done, or</hi> spoken <hi>against His Majesties</hi> Person, <hi>Honour Crown, or Dignitie, you swoare to let, and withstand the same to the uttermost of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and either cause it to be revealed to Himselfe, or to others of His Privy Counsell:</hi> The Oaths you took when Bedchamber man, &amp; L. Chamberlain bind you as strictly to His <hi>Person.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Lordship may also call to memorie when you were installed Knight of the Garter, (whereof you are now the oldest living except aK. of <hi>Denmark</hi>) you solemnly swore <hi>to defend the Honour, and Quarrels, the Rights and Lordship of your Soveraigne:</hi> Now the Record tells us that the chiefest ground of instituting that Order by that heroick Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was, that he might have choice gallant men, who by Oath and Honour should adhere unto him in all dangers, and difficulties, and that by way of reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he should protect and defend them; Which made <hi>Alfonso</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> so much importune <hi>Henry</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:94588:38"/> Eight to install him one of the Knights of the Garter, that he might engage King <hi>Harry</hi> to protect him against <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, who threatned then the conquest of <hi>Naples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How your Lordship hath acquitted your selfe of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these Oaths your conscience (that bosome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord) can make the best affidavit; Some of them oblige you <hi>to live and dye</hi> with King <hi>Charles,</hi> but what Oaths or any thing like an Oath binds you to live and die with the <hi>House of Commons,</hi> as your Lordship often gives out you will, I am yet to learne: Unlesse that House which hath not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer as much as to administer an Oath (much lesse to make one) can <hi>absolve</hi> you from your former Oaths, or haply by their omnipotence <hi>dispence</hi> with you for the observance of them. Touching the <hi>Politicall</hi> capacitie of the King I feare that will be a weak plea for your Lordship before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunall of heaven, and they who whispers such Chimeras in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your eares abuse you in grosse; but put case there were such a thing as politicall capacitie distinct from the personall, which to a true rational man is one of the grossest Buls that can be, yet these forementioned Oaths relate most of them meerly unto the Kings <hi>Person,</hi> the individuall Person of King <hi>Charles</hi> as you are His domestick Counsellor, and cubicular Servant.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, I take leave to tell your Lordship (and the Spectator sees sometimes more then the Gamster) that the world extreamely marvels at you more then others, and it makes those who wish you best to be transformed to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that your Lordship should be the first of your Race who deserted the <hi>Crowne,</hi> which one of your Progenitors said, he would still follow though it were thrown upon a hedge: Had your Princely Brother been living he would have been sooner torne by wild horses than have banded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, or abandoned the King his Master, and fallen to
<pb facs="tcp:94588:38"/> such grosse Idolatry as to worship the <hi>Beast with many heads.</hi> The world also stands astonished that you should confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to bring into the bowels of the Land, and make Elogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums of that hungry people which have been from all times so crosse and fatall to the English Nation, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to your <hi>own</hi> honour: Many thousands do wonder that your Lordship should be brought to persecute with so much animosity and hatred that reverend <hi>Order</hi> in Gods Church which is contemporary with Christianity it self, and whereunto you had once designed, and devoted one of your dearest Sonnes so solemnly.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, if this Monster of Reformation (which is like an infernall Spirit clad in white, and hath a cloven head as well as feet) prevailes you shall find the same destiny will attend poore <hi>England,</hi> as did <hi>Bohemia</hi> which was one of the flourishingst Kingdoms upon this part of the earth; The Common people there repind at the Hierarchy and riches of the Church, thereupon a Parliament was pack'd where Bishops were demolish'd, what followed? The Nobles and Gentry went down next, and afterwards the Crown it self, and so it became a popular confus'd Anarchicall State, and a Stage of bloud along time, so that at last, when this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got had done working in the braines of the foolish people, they were glad to have recourse to Monarchy againe after a world of calamities; though it degenerated from a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Kingdom to an Elective. Me thinks, my Lord, under favour that those notorious visible judgements which have fallen upon these Refiners of reform'd <hi>Religion</hi> should un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beguile your Lordship, and open your eyes: For the hand of heaven never appeared so cleerly in any humane actions: Your Lordship may well remember what became of the <hi>Hothams,</hi> and Sir <hi>Alexander Cary</hi> who were the two fatall wretches that began the War first, one in the <hi>North,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:94588:39"/> in the <hi>South;</hi> Your Lordship may be also pleased to remember what became of <hi>Brooks</hi> the Lord, and <hi>Hampden,</hi> the first whereof was dispatched by a deafe &amp; dumb man out of an ancient Church which he was battering, and that sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly also, for he fell stone dead in the twinkling of an eye; Now, one of the greatest cavils he had against our <hi>Lyturgie</hi> was a clause of a Prayer there against <hi>sudden death,</hi> besides the fagge end of his Grace in that journey was, that if the design was not pleasing to God, he might perish in the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For the other wiseaker he be-sprinkled with his bloud, and received his death upon the same clod of earth in <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi>-shire where he had first assembled the poore Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people like so many Geese to drive them gaggling in a mutiny to <hi>London</hi> with the Protestation in their Caps, which hath been since torne in flitters, and is now grown ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solet and quite out of use. Touching <hi>Pym</hi> &amp; <hi>Stroud,</hi> those two worthy Champions of the <hi>Vtopian</hi> cause, the first being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his stomack and guts were found to be full of pellets of bloud, the other had little or no braine at all left in his skull being dead, &amp; lesse when he was living: For <hi>Hollis</hi> who carried the first scandalous Remonstrance (that work of night, &amp; the verdict of a starv'd jury) to welcome the King <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>rom <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was the first of the <hi>five</hi> Members who were impeached by his Majestie, he hath been since, your Lordship knowes, the chiefe of the <hi>Eleven</hi> Members impeached by themselves, but with this difference, that they had justice against him, though the King could get none: But now this St. <hi>Hollis</hi> with the rest are a kind of Runnagates beyond the Seas, scorn'd by all mankind, and baffled every where, yea, even by the <hi>Boors</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and not daring to peep in any populous Town but by owle-light.</p>
                  <p>Moreover I beleeve your Lordship hath good cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the same kind of riotous Rascals which rabled
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94588:39"/> the King out of towne, did drive away the Speaker in like manner with many of their Memb<seg rend="sup">sps</seg>, amongst whom your Lordship was fairly on his way, to seek shelter of their Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries: Your L<seg rend="sup">P</seg> must needs find what deadly fewds fall daily 'twixt the Presbyterian and the Independent the two fiery brands that have put this poore Isle so long in combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. But 'tis worthy your Lordships speciall notice how your deare Brethren the Scots (whom your Lordship so highly magnified in some of your publike Speeches) who were at first brought in for Hirelings against the King for them, offer themselves now to come in against them for the King: Your Lordship cannot be ignorant of the sundry clashes that have been 'twixt the City and their Memberships, and 'twixt their Memberships and their men of war; who have often wav'd &amp; disobeyed their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: How this tatterdimallian Army hath reduc'd this cow'd City, the cheated Country, and their once all-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Masters, to a perfect passe of slavery, to a true a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinin condition; They crow over all the ancient Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdome, though there be not found amongst them all but two Knights; and 'tis well knowne there be hundreds of private Gentlemen in the Kingdom, the poorest of whom, is able to buy this whole Host with the Generall himselfe and all the Commanders: But 'tis not the first time, that the Kings and Nobility of England have been baffled by petty companions: I have read of <hi>Jack Straw, Wat Tyler,</hi> and <hi>Ket</hi> the Tanner, with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that did so, but being suppressed it tended to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the King at last; and what a world of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are there in our story, that those Noblemen who ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against the Crown, the revenge of heaven ever found them out early or late at last.</p>
                  <p>These, with a black cloud of reciprocall judgements
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94588:40"/> more, which have come home to these Reformers very doores, shew that the hand of divine justice is in't, and the holy Prophet tels us, <hi>When Gods judgements are upon earth, then the inhabitants shall learne justice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching your Lordship in particular, you have not, under favour, escap'd without some already, &amp; I wish more may not follow; your Lordship may remember you lost one Sonne at <hi>Bridgenorth,</hi> your deare Daughter at <hi>Oxford,</hi> your Son-in-law at <hi>Newbury,</hi> your Daughter-in-law at the <hi>Charter-house</hi> of an infamous disease, how sickly your el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Son hath been; how part of your house was burnt in the country, with others which <hi>I</hi> will not now mention.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> will conclude this point with an observation of the most monstrous number of Witches that have swarm'd since these Wars against the King, (more <hi>I</hi> dare say) then have been in this island since the Devill tempted <hi>Eve;</hi> for in two Counties only there have been neer upon three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred arraign'd, and eightscore executed; what a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous devilish office one had, under colour of examination, to torment poore silly women with watchings, pinchings, and other artifices to find them for Witches: How others by a new invention of villany were conniv'd at for seizing upon young children, and hurrying them on ship-board, where they were so transform'd that their Parents could not know them, and so were carryed over for new schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Plantations. My Lord, there is no villany that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the imagination of man hath been left here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed; no crime from the highest Treason to the meanest Trespasse but these Reformers are guilty of. What horrid acts of prophanes have been perpetrated up and down! the Monuments of the dead have bin rifled! Horses have been watred at the Church Font, and fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the holy Table! Widows, Orphans, and Hospitals
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94588:40"/> have been commonly robb'd, and Gods House hath been plunder'd more then any! with what infandous blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have the Pulpits rung, one crying out, that <hi>this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was as necessary for our Reformation, as the comming of Christ was for our Redemption:</hi> Another belching out, that if <hi>God Almighty did not prosper this Cause, 'twere fitting hee should change places with the Devil:</hi> Another, <hi>that the worst things our Saviour did, was the making of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prayer, and saving the Thief upon the Crosse.</hi> O immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall God, is it possible that England should produce such Monsters, or rather such infernall fiends shap'd with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodyes! yet your Lordship sides with these men, though they be enemies to the Cross, to the Church, and to the very name of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> Ile instance only in two who were esteem'd the Oracles of this holy Reformation, <hi>Peters,</hi> and <hi>Saltmarsh;</hi> The first is known by thousands to be an infamous, jugling and scandalous villaine, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feats, he got the Mother and Daughter with Child, as it was offered to be publickly proved; <hi>I</hi> could speak much of the other, but being dead, let it suffice that he died mad and desperate. These were accounted the two Apostles of the times.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, 'tis high time for you to recollect your selfe, to enter into the private closet of your thoughts, and sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them all to counsel upon your pillow; consider well the slavish condition your dear Country is in, weigh well the sad case your liege Lord and Master is in, how he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reav'd of his Queen, His Children, His Servants, His Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and of every thing in which there is any comfort; observe well, how neverthelesse, God Almighty works in Him, by inspiring Him with equality and calmnesse of mind, with patience, prudence and constancy, how Hee makes His very Crosses to stoop unto Him, when His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94588:41"/> will not: Consider the monstrousnesse of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions that are tendred him, wherein no lesse then Crown, Scepter, &amp; Sword, which are things in-alienable from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, are in effect demanded, nay they would not only have him transmit, and resign his very intellectuals unto them, but they would have him make a sacrifice of his soule, by forcing him to violate that solemne sacramentall Oath hee took at his Coronation when hee was no <hi>Minor,</hi> but come to a full maturity of reason and judgement: make it your own case, My Lord, and that's the best way to judge of His: Thinke upon the multiplicity of solemne astringing Oathes your Lordship hath taken, most whereof directly and solely enjoyne faith and loyalty to his Person; oh my Lord! wrong not your soule so much, in comparison of whom your body is but a rag of rottennesse.</p>
                  <p>Consider that acts of loyalty to the Crowne are the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest columns to bear up a Noblemans name to future ages, and register it in the temple of immortality. Reconcile your self therfore speedily unto your liege Lord &amp; Master, think upon the infinite private obligations you have had both to <hi>Sire</hi> and <hi>Son:</hi> The Father kiss'd you often, kisse you now the <hi>Sun</hi> left he be too angry; <hi>And Kings,</hi> you will find, my Lord, <hi>are like the Sun in the heavens, which may be clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a time, yet he is still in his sphear, and will break out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and shine as gloriously as ever;</hi> Let me tell your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that the people begin to grow extream weary of their Physitians, they find the remedy to be far worse then their former disease; nay they stick not to call some of them meer Quacksalvers rather then Physitians; Some goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and say they are no more Parliament, than a Pye-powder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Pluto vouchsafed to be present and preside at this Counsell, and to be <hi>Chaireman</hi> himself, to which purpose he had a strong Legion of <hi>Cacodaemons</hi> for his guard, but the businesse was prepared and facilitated for his hearing before hand by a <hi>Committee</hi> appointed of purpose for that end, whence I inferred that <hi>Committees</hi> were first hatcht in Hell, especially some of those that we have now adaies. The three ghastly daughters of Night appeard with dreadfull fiery countenances before Puto, in lieu of aire they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94588:46"/> evaporated huge flakes of fire, which they tooke in, and let out with the accents of their words, huge bunches of Snakes with their tailes rooted in their sculls hung dangling and waving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their heads like dischevelld haire: A furious contestation fell between them who should be Proloquutrix, but in regard that <hi>Alecto</hi> and <hi>Tisyphone</hi> had given an account of their former missions, the one of the <hi>League</hi> in France, the other of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt</hi> of the Hollander, it came now in due turn that <hi>Megara</hi> should have the priority of speech, so the youngest of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Girls began as followes;</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94588:46"/> other people, we went jointly thither all three, because we might be sure to bring out ends home to our aime. The Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fittest for us to work first upon was the <hi>Scot,</hi> who have been so obedient to their Kings, that of above a hundred they brag of, scarce two parts of three dyed in their beds; We did su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scitate them first against their native King, and to appeare in a daring hostile manner before him upon the borders; At which time it cost us a great deale of labour so to besot the English, to abase their courage, and entangle them with Factions (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sure confidents among them to that end) that they durst not present them battell, and this Sir was an important peece of service, for had they fought then, or had they been sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble afterwards of the Nationall dishonor they received at that time, their King being in the field, and consequently had they stucke to him afterwards to have vindicated it, all those Wars we have fomented since might have been prevented: We shortly after transmitted the same Spirit of Insurrection into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who being encouraged by the good successes the <hi>Scot</hi> had (for he had what he list, yet could he not sit quiet) and the <hi>Irish</hi> Commissioners being but harshly entertained by this English Parlement who intended to send over a Deputy that should pinch them more than they were before in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, besides in that they revoked that leave which the King had granted under hand and seale to the Spanish Ambassadors to have some part of <hi>Straffords</hi> Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> (which were our prime instruments for the Rebellion) to go for <hi>Spaine,</hi> with other incentives, we stird the <hi>Irish</hi> also to rise in bloud, which they did to some purpose. Then came we to worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>English,</hi> whom we found as fit to receive our impression as Flax is to take fire, in regard of their long surfet of peace and plenty. We broke up one Parlement because most of the Members thereof were not for our turn; The first thing we did in <hi>this</hi> Parlement was to indue them with a faculty to create feares and jealousies whereof we have made excellent use, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94588:47"/> although all those feares and jealousies appeare since to the common people, and City of <hi>London,</hi> more plain than their nose on their faces to be but forgeries, yet we have so infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated their intellectualls that we make them still adore the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of them. And to give your <hi>Stygian</hi> Majestie among divers others one more pregnant and undeniable demonstration what footing you have got you in that Island, we have within these few yeares raised more <hi>Pythonesses</hi> (which the vulgar call witches there) than ever were in that Island since your Majesty tempted <hi>Eve:</hi> And we enabled our <hi>Pythonesses</hi> to send their Imps abroad in pursuit of your service. We stood at the Kings elbo when he passed that happy <hi>Act of continuance,</hi> and and a <hi>Scot</hi> was our cheifest engine to work that; The City of <hi>London</hi> stood us also in excellent stead to bring our designes about; We made the riff-raff of that City, as <hi>V.</hi> with his Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mydons, and <hi>B.</hi> with his bandogs (for so they called the rak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells they had raised) to <hi>rabble</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94588:47"/> delivered him over as a Sacrifice, and betraid him like <hi>Iudas</hi> to the English who have crucified ever since like <hi>Iewes,</hi> by tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and tumbling him up and down, and by compulsory meanes to work upon His conscience, and stretching it upon the tenter; VVe made <hi>Pembrock</hi> Castle, and <hi>Colchester,</hi> with other single (or rather simple) Counties to rise of purpose to betray themselves: In summe, we have reduced that Kingdom to a new conformity with this of your Majesties, to a sweet Chaos of all confusion, we have brought the sway solely into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peoples hands; And never did common people more tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly act the part, and discover the genious of a common people more lively, whose nature is still thursting after novelties and Utopian reformations, though they foole themselves thereby into a baser kind of slavery, finding when 'tis too late those sprecious idaeas, and confused formes of Government they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended before, and hugg'd in their own conceits to be meer absurdities, when they come to the application and practice of them.</p>
                     <p>And Sir, the most advantagious instruments we have used to bring all this about, have been the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and the <hi>Presse;</hi> by these we diffus'd those surmises and suppositious feares for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly spoken of, to intoxicate the braines of the people: In stead of <hi>Lights</hi> we put <hi>Firebrands</hi> into their Churches, who, as we did dictate unto them, did bawle out nothing but Sedition and Bloud, we have made some of them to bring divers to have as good an opinion of the <hi>Alchoran</hi> as of their Liturgie; we have made secular <hi>Ordinances</hi> to batter down all ancient Ecclesiastick <hi>Canons;</hi> we have made them to unsaint all those whom they call Apostles in heaven, and to rob their Churches on earth; we have made them put division twixt the <hi>Trinity</hi> it self; we have made their Pulpiteers to preach the Law and <hi>your Kingdome</hi> in the Church, but the Gospell and Heaven in the Chamber; we have brought them to keep their <hi>Fast</hi> day more solemnly then the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> upon which, we have made them not only to sit in Counsell, but to put in execution all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94588:48"/> designs of bloud. But the main, and most materiall thing we have made use of, was <hi>spirituall pride,</hi> your Majesties old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, which we have infused into the mind of every Mecanique and Countrey Swaine, who will boldly now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to expound any Text of Scripture, New or Ol, dupon the warrant of their owne braines, and by the light of their own fires; Insomuch that we have made that Book which they call the <hi>Bible,</hi> that was ordained first for their <hi>Salvation,</hi> to be the chiefest Instrument of their <hi>Damnation</hi> VVe have brought these Exotic words, <hi>Plundering</hi> and <hi>Storming,</hi> which were never known among them before, and that once abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable word, <hi>Excise,</hi> to be now familiar among them, they are made all three free Denizons, and legitimated among them; VVe have rais'd an Army of the dreggs of the people, though of precious stuffe to your Majesty, and so puffed them with the pride of their good successes, and so flesh'd them in Bloud, that they are no more tender of a mans or womans life then they are of a dog or a cats; We have made those that came Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners for Peace to be <hi>murthered,</hi> and those that came for VVar to be thanked and <hi>hugged;</hi> VVe have reduced them to such slavery as to make the very countenances of men to be commented upon, and their very thoughts to be plundred; We have made the mother to betray her child, the child the father, the husband his wife, the servant his master; VVe have brought a perfect tyranny ore their very <hi>soules</hi> and <hi>bodies;</hi> upon the one, by tedious and endlesse imprisonment, with the forfeiture of all their livelihoods before conviction or charge; upon the other, by forcing them to swallow contradictory Oaths. On that foolish superstitious day call'd <hi>Christmas,</hi> with other Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivalls, we have brought them to shut up their Churches, and open their shops, so that in time they will forget the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry memory of their Saviours Incarnation; We have brought them to have as little reverence of their <hi>Temples</hi> as of their <hi>Tap-houses,</hi> and to hold the <hi>Church</hi> to be but a Charnell-house
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94588:48"/> of rotten bones; and though they cringe, and knee, and stand bare before any wrangling Bench of Common Pleas, yet we have so stiffned their <hi>joints,</hi> and made their <hi>heads</hi> so tender in that which they call Gods House, that they can neither <hi>bow</hi> the one there, nor scarce <hi>uncover</hi> the other; We have fil'd lately the Tribunals in <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall with Favourers of your Cause, which makes some of them look rather like <hi>Iuglers</hi> than <hi>Iudges;</hi> We have made the Fundamentals of Law to be term'd but Formalities; We have caus'd <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to be torne to a thousand flitters, and stretched the privilege of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons so wide, that it hath swallowed up all other; We have grub'd up and cast away those hopefull Plants that grew in their two <hi>Seminaries</hi> of Learning, and set in their room grafts of our own choice. And Sir, your precious children, and our deare brethren, the Angels of the Army, have comported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves notably for the improvement of your Majesties service in all these things, into whom we have infus'd such principles that <hi>Machiavill</hi> himself were he alive there, would be accounted a Baby in comparison of them. Among divers other wholsome maximes, we have instill'd this into their braines, that <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies must be supported by Villaines, and mischief cannot be safe but by attempting greater;</hi> We have made the wealth of Town and Countrey, of poore and rich, to glitter in Plunder upon their backs; We make them to command Free-quarter of those who who were fitter to aske <hi>them</hi> Almes; We have made them to rifle the Monuments of the Dead, to rob the Lazaretto, to strip the Orphane and Widow, to violate and pillage all things that were dedicated to God; We have made them wreek their revenge upon the very vegetables, to make socks of Surplices, to water their beasts at the Font, to feed them on the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Table, and to terme the thing they call a Sacrament, a Two penny Banquet: Sir, we have turn'd supposed <hi>Superstition</hi> to absolute <hi>Prophanesse,</hi> Government to Confusion, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to pure Slavery; We have brought their King to live
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94588:49"/> in a manner upon Charity, and His Queen to beg of the French Friers, and His Children to be a kind of Runnagates up and downe the world; We have so intoxicated that deare Daughter of yours the City of <hi>London,</hi> that she knowes not which way to turn her self; And whereas her Apprentices did rise up like <hi>Tigers</hi> against their King, they are now become as so many silly <hi>Sheepe</hi> against our Army; We have puzzled them with such vertiginous fancies and feares among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that one neighbour dare not trust the other. To conclude Sir, we have eclips'd the glory of the English Nation, we have made them by all people far and near that ever had knowledge of them, to be pittied by some, to be derided by others, to be scorn'd of all, and to become the very taile of all Nations; In fine Sir, we have brought that Kingdom to such a passe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, that it is a fit place only for your Imperial <hi>Phlegetontic</hi> Majesty to inhabit; And Sir, there's never a Crosse now there fright you, unlesse it be upon their Coines of Gold and Silver, wheron they leave Crosses to be still in honour of your <hi>Pluto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Highnesse, as you are <hi>Dis,</hi> and God of riches.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94588:51"/> suffrances, nor <hi>pitty</hi> towards others, but their nature is so accursed, that they wish their neighbors torments to be greater then their own: Besides, their torments never lessen either by tract of time or degree of sence, but they persever alwaies the same; they are still fresh, and the soule able to beare them. I saw that <hi>everlasting Villaine</hi> who committed the first Sacrilege we read of, by burning <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple, and his torments were as fresh and violent upon him as they were the first day he was thrown in thither; <hi>Iudas</hi> was in the same degree and strength of torture as the first moment he fell thither; <hi>Iack Cade, Wat Tyler, Iack Straw, Kit the Tanner</hi> did fry there as fresh as they did that instant they were cast thither: Amongst whom it made my heart to melt within me to see some of their new-com'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen amongst them, whereof I knew divers: And though <hi>Society</hi> useth to be some <hi>solace</hi> to men in misery, yet they conceived no comfort at all by these fresh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
                     <p>It is high time for us now said my good guiding An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to be gone to the other world, so we directed our course towards the Ferry upon <hi>Styx;</hi> Lord, what varities of lurid, and ugly squalid countenances did I behold as I passed! There was one sort of torment I had not seene before, there were divers that hung by their tongues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on posts up and down; I asked what they were, answer was made, that they were English Divines, and Lawyers, who against their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> as well as their <hi>Consciences,</hi> did seduce the ignorant people of <hi>England</hi> in the late Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Warre. A little further I might see abundance of <hi>Committee-men</hi> and others, slopping up drops of moulten lead in lieu of French-barley broath, with a rabble of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94588:52"/> sweeping the gutters of Hell, with brooms tufted with Addars and Snakes, because they resorting to the Wars, had thereby broke their Indentures with their Masters, and their Oaths of Supremacy to their Prince.</p>
                     <p>Passing then along towards the Ferry, a world of hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous shapes presented themselves unto me; there I saw <hi>Corroding cares, panick feares, pining grief, lethargy, sleep, ugly rebellion, revengefull malice, snakie discord, and spirituall pride,</hi> the sin that first peopled Hell: Couches of Toads, Adders, and Scorpions in a corner hard by, I ask'd for whom they were prepared, I was answered, for some English <hi>Evangelizing, Anabaptisticall, and Legislative La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> which make writing of Notes at Sermons, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion a meere vaile to cover their hypocrisie; So having me thought by a miraculous providence charm'd <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> by pointing at him with the signe of the Crosse upon the fingers, we passed quietly by him, and being come to the Ferry, I found true what <hi>Pluto</hi> had said before, that there was a new English <hi>Tarpaulin</hi> entertained by <hi>Charon,</hi> but he was in a most cruell torture, for his body was covered thicke all over with Pitch and Tarre, which burnt and flam'd round about him: And here the <hi>Trance</hi> left me.</p>
                     <p>Having thus come out of this sad swound, I began by a serious recollection of my self to recall to my thoughts those dismall and dreadfull objects that had appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; for though I was in Hell I did not taste of <hi>Lethe</hi> all the while, so that I did not forget any thing that I had seen; all things seem'd to appeare unto me so really, that if I had been of that opinion (wherof many have been) that Devills are <hi>nothing else but the ill affections, the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant passions, and perturbances of the mind,</hi> it had been able
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94588:52"/> to have convinced me. The Reader may easily imagine what apprehensions of horror these apparitions left in my braine: For as a River being by an inundation swell'd out of her wonted Channell leaves along the neighbouring Medowes seggs and sands, and much riff-raff stuffe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind her upon her return to her former bed; So did this <hi>Extasis,</hi> with that deluge of objects wherewith it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd my braine, leave behind it blacke sudds, and gastly thoughts within me, which have done me no hurt I thank God for it, it being a true rule that <hi>Malum cognitum faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius evitatur:</hi> And I wish they may produce the same effects in the Reader as they did in the Author. VVe find in the Sacred Oracles that <hi>Dives</hi> in his discourse from Hell with <hi>Abraham,</hi> wish'd that some body might be sent from the dead to informe and reclaime his Brothers upon earth, because the words of a <hi>dead man</hi> would gaine more credit with them then any others. Let the Readers of this <hi>Trance</hi> make account that the Author was <hi>such a one;</hi> for he hath been <hi>buried</hi> many years, and so let it work within him accordingly.</p>

                     <p>But I intend not to involve my discourse in these mistie times, but will take my rise from the Norman Conquest, for indeed the Historie of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> being overclouded with so many incertainties, casteth but a dim light before those times, whereas since, she shines with such a lustre, that what stands upon Record may be asserted for cleere and undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth.</p>
                     <p>At that time, I mean the time of the Conquest, <hi>Scotland</hi> did <hi>England</hi> a very good office by preserving the English blood-royall (which not long after returned to the Crowne in <hi>Henry</hi> the second) but it was casuallyâª For Prince <hi>Edgar</hi> and his Mother, with his two Sisters, intending to goe for <hi>Denmarke,</hi> (some say for <hi>Hungarie</hi>) and being by distresse of weather driven upon the Scottish coasts, they were hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Then he summons a Parliament at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> where all the Nobles sweare him fealty againe; He carrieth away the Ragman roll, the blacke crosse, and the stone wherein they say the fate of their Kingdome is fixed.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94588:57"/> and as some stories record above 40000. more were slaine. Which defeat was imputed principally to the ill choice of ground the English had taken. The Scots had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them rocks, hills, and woods to fly into if necessity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, before them loughs, and moores, that the assailant could not march further. Adde hereunto the pusillanimity of the King (and the spirits of men are much raysed by their leader) who was sayd to fly first: and better it is for a lion to lead sheepe, then for a sheepe to lead a company of lions.</p>
                        <p>The Scots hereupon were so agog that they enter <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with an Army under the conduct of <hi>Edward Bruce</hi> the Kings brother, who landing at <hi>Karig Fergus</hi> ransack'd all the North parts, where he tooke such firme footing, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claym'd himselfe King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though he had onely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranne <hi>Ulster.</hi> At which time there was such a direfull famine, that in some places of <hi>Ireland</hi> dead bodies were digged up, and their flesh boyled in their sculls to be eaten, as the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tells.</p>
                        <p>But two yeares after, Sir <hi>Io. Bremingham</hi> then chiefe Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, with the Archbishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> went with such a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er against this upstart King, that at <hi>Dundalke</hi> they got a most compleat victory, one <hi>Manpas</hi> as it seemed having kild the King hand to hand, for both their dead bodies were found together, and <hi>Manpas</hi> covering the Kings body.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>England</hi> another Army was sent against the Scots, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Yorke</hi> Army, which was also overthrowne at <hi>Milton</hi> upon <hi>Swayle.</hi> Nevertheles the King would venture once more in Person, and with a numerous Army invaded <hi>Scotland;</hi> The Scots fly into the woods, and places of fastnes; And for want of provision in that hungry country, the English were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire, but in the retraict they were so pursued that they lost all their ammunition, which was attributed to the treason of Sir <hi>Andrew Harkley.</hi> But your criticall Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists ascribe it to the poverty of spirit in the royall head, who being become hatefull to God, and man, first for perjury, by infringing the oath he made to his Barons; then by disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his father who in his death bed charged him upon his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94588:57"/> blessing to abandon <hi>Piers Gaveston,</hi> whom nevertheless he still doted upon with the <hi>Spencers,</hi> by whose counsels hee guided himselfe, And it was alwaies seen that Princes of an ill desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny follow the worst counsells.</p>

                        <p>In the Parliament held at <hi>Northampton,</hi> the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was released of his homage; But some years after, when the young King began to understand himself, hee sent an army with <hi>Balioll,</hi> whom he caused to be crowned at <hi>Scone;</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards there was a Battell fought at Hallidowne, where the English made the Scots a bridge of gold to fly over, for they betook themselves all to their heeles.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Balioll</hi> being thus restored, <hi>Scotland</hi> became feudita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>England</hi> againe.</p>
                        <p>But a few years after king <hi>Ed.</hi> being deeply engag'd in his French wars, and thinking <hi>Hoc agere,</hi> the Scots presuming his absence would prove advantagious to them, make cursorie sallies out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and plunder all before them in the North, by the instigation of the French.</p>
                        <p>But the Queen and the Lords of the North make such a levy of Martiall forces, that they entred <hi>Scotland</hi> like thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and at a mighty battell one <hi>Copland</hi> takes the King priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whom, pleading the law of arms he would not deliver the Queen, untill the King had sent order from <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This overthrow was given upon Saturday, and upon Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day six weeks before the battell of <hi>Cressy</hi> had bin fought, with another against the Duke of <hi>Brittain;</hi> in all which king <hi>Edward</hi> prov'd victorious. And being triumphantly return'd from <hi>France,</hi> with the Flower-de-luces upon his sword, and redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now by all the Princes of the Christian world having a triumverate of kings his prisoners, one would think the Scot would have bin quiet, but they still provoked him so far, that

The King being returned to <hi>London,</hi> grew more and more sensible of these indignities of his Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and having called a Parliament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly for that purpose in <hi>England,</hi> some of the cheife Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof were so intoxicated by the <hi>Scot,</hi> that they did not only not resent this bravado he had done to <hi>England,</hi> but seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to approve of his actions. His Majesty finding the pulse of his Parliament beat so faintly for enabling him to vindicate these indignities upon the <hi>Scot,</hi> dissolv'd it, and propos'd the businesse to his privy Counsell, who not only advis'd him, but supplyed him with noble summes to repaire his honour by War; hereupon the former Forces were rallied, and made up into the body of an Army: The <hi>Scot</hi> was not idle all this while, but reunited his former Army, whereof there was a good part undisbanded (contrary to Article) and choosing rather to make another Country the theater of the War then his own, he got over the <hi>Tweed,</hi> and found all passages open, and as it were made for him al the way til he came to the <hi>Tine,</hi> &amp; though there were considerable Troupes of Horse and Foot at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castle,</hi> yet they never offer'd as much as to face him all the way; at <hi>Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94588:62"/> determine; but sure I am it was dishonourable enough to poor <hi>England,</hi> who was bought and sold in this expedition. This was the first entrance the <hi>Scot</hi> made into <hi>England</hi> since these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Wars; but this invitation was private, the last was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, being voted by the <hi>English</hi> Commons, and they rush'd in, in the dead of Winter; notwithstanding that his Majesty had taken a toylsome journey not long before to sit amongst them himselfe in Parliament, where he condescended to every thing they could imaginably desire, and they acknowledging his unparaleld Grace, desired that Act to be reviv'd whereby it was Treason in the highest degree that could be, for any of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Scotland</hi> of what degree or condition soever to levy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mlitary Forces without his Majesties expresse Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this they did to expresse their gratitude: as they said. But the yeare came scarce about before they had moulded ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Army, not only without, but expresly against his Royall Commission, and Counter-command, and would intrude themselves to be Vmpires twixt him and his <hi>English</hi> Subjects whither he would or no; so in they rush'd againe in dead of Winter, and for Martiall exployts, the little credit they got by storming of <hi>Newcastle</hi> was nothing countervaylable to that which they lost before <hi>Hereford,</hi> where the <hi>Welsh-men</hi> bang'd them to some purpose from before the town, and made their Generall to trusse up his pack and away, sending him a fat Sow with Pigs after her, and a blew bonnet upon her head for his break-fast.</p>

                  <p>THus have I run over, and faithfull related by collation of many Authors, with their concurrent testimonies, those traverses of warre which have passed betwixt the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> since the Conquest, having omitted many circumstances which might have tended further to the glory of <hi>England,</hi> to avoyd prolixity, for I intended at first that this Discourse should be like a skein of Silke wound up close upon a small bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, which a freer hand might put upon the loom and draw to a large peice.</p>
                  <p>Any man of a clear and unpassionate judgement will hence inferre that the <hi>Scots</hi> have been alwayes farre inferiour to the <hi>English</hi> (except in these latter unlucky Invasions) in poynt of true prowesse, and National Power: In some examples you may finde how the <hi>English</hi> carryed away more Captives then they were Souldiers of themselves, driving them as sheep before them; most of the Battails they fought were in <hi>Scotland</hi> herself, when the <hi>English</hi> had been tir'd with long marches, over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, and strange places, being ignorant of the advenues, and advantages of them.</p>
                  <p>Indeed in <hi>Edward</hi> the Seconds reign they got three battails, and one at the fag end of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. wherein Sir <hi>Ralph Evers</hi> was slaine, but it was more by stratagem than strength, and besides the <hi>English</hi> might have been said to have fought rather against the Heaven and Elements then men, having Wind and Sun in their faces, but that might have been tearmed more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a petty defeat then Victory, for there fell not above 200. But what use did the <hi>Scot</hi> ever make of those Victories, though the North parts have many places of fastnesse, and tenable, yet I reade not of any place they kept except <hi>Barwick;</hi> all the rest of their Warres were but tumultuary sallies, and predatory devastations, and pilfrings. But the <hi>English</hi> have taken foure
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94588:63"/> of their Kings captives, killed two of them in the Field, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away their Crown (which they give out to be greater and more weighty than that of <hi>England</hi>) their <hi>Ragman-Roll,</hi> the <hi>Blacke Crosse,</hi> with other instruments of Soveraignty, and did sundry acts equivalent to a Conquest. They pierced the very heart of the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>ngdom, and the <hi>Scot</hi> may be said to have onely trod upon <hi>England</hi> toe, for they never came farther than the Walls of <hi>Yorke,</hi> till the reigne of this thing that cals it selfe Parliament. But if one should aske me why the <hi>English</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made such firme Invasions from time to time into the very bowels of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did not reduce it to a vassallage and perfect provincial obedience, as well as to make their Kings fuedetary in which state they continued towards <hi>England</hi> near upon five hundred yeares?</p>
                  <p>My Answer shall be the same that <hi>Suetonius</hi> gives in behalfe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who notwithstanding they lorded, over the rest of <hi>Brittany</hi> four hundred and odde yeares, yet they never went about to conquer <hi>Scotland,</hi> because they knew the prize would not have countervail'd the paines, by reason of the cragginesse of the Countrey and incommodity of habitation, therefore they thought it enough that <hi>Adrians</hi> Wall which extended from <hi>Tinmouth</hi> to <hi>Solway Frith,</hi> near upon fourscore miles should be the Westerne Bounds of their Empire.</p>
                  <p>Out of the precedent Examples we may also gather, that the <hi>Scot</hi> hath been alwayes of a genius apt and forward to stir against <hi>England</hi> upon any the least occasion. For of those five and twenty Kings and Queens that have been since the Conquest, onely five have been free of their insolencies: yet did <hi>England</hi> never begin with them till she was justly provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thereunto, nor could Alliances nor Leagues, or any tyes of Treaty confirmed by Solemne Oathes (which are those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Bonds that passe 'twixt God and the Soul) detain the <hi>Scotish</hi> Kings from puzling and disturbing <hi>England,</hi> when her Kings were most distracted in Warres with <hi>France,</hi> and the better halfe of her strength imployed abroad, so that the <hi>Scots</hi> may be said to have been from time to time as goads in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> sides, or a thorne in her toe; and <hi>France</hi> leaguing meerly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94588:63"/> for his own advantage with them, may be said to have made use of <hi>Scotland</hi> as the Fox did of the Cats foot to pull the Apple out of the Fire for his own eating: yet for all these eager and irrefragable Combinations 'twixt the <hi>French</hi> and Her against <hi>England, England</hi> ever bore up, and made her party good, and that in a victorious way against both, and for <hi>Scotland</hi> she may be said to have given Her blowes for phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips.</p>
                  <p>But it seemes that <hi>Italian</hi> was well versed in the <hi>Scotishmens</hi> humours, who understanding of the late Vnion between the two Kingdomes, said that <hi>England</hi> had got no great catch by the addition of <hi>Scotland,</hi> she had onely got a Wolfe by the eares, who must be held very fast, else he will run away to <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some there are who much magnifie and cry up the <hi>Scots</hi> of late yeares, for great Souldiers, tacitly derogating thereby from the <hi>English,</hi> as if they should stand in some apprehension of fear of them; but I cannot imagine upon what grounds they should do it; true it is, that since the Revolt of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> and these seventy yeares Tumults in the Netherlands, some of them are much improved in the Art of Warre, and knowledge of Armes from what they were; they have also pushed on their Fortunes in the Warres of <hi>Denmarke, Sweden, Russia, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> for <hi>Poland,</hi> their Profession there is to trusse Packes rather than traile Pikes. By reason of the quality of the Soile and Clime they have tough and hardy bodies, and it may adde to their courage that they venture for a better Countrey, in regard they cannot go to a worse than their own. Now it must be granted that the greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage wherewith Nature doth recompence a mountainous and sterile Soile above a luxurious and easie, is, to make it produce suffering bodies; which made the <hi>Romans</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the first, 'tis answered, that if the <hi>Scot</hi> hath made sallies abroad into other Countries of late yeares, the <hi>English</hi> also have done the like, and are in some places in greater nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94588:64"/> as in the Low-countries, where at this day they treble the number of the <hi>Scots,</hi> so that the <hi>Netherlands</hi> may be said to be a Military Yard for the <hi>English</hi> as well: and he that is never so little versed in the Moderne Stories will finde that the Foundation of that State hath been chiefly cimented with <hi>English</hi> Bloud.</p>
                  <p>For the East-countrey, 'tis true, there are many able <hi>Scots</hi> Leaders, and there are also many <hi>English</hi> of abilities and fame.</p>
                  <p>To the second, if the <hi>Scots</hi> are a hardy People because of their cragges and mountaines: I answer that the <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Cornish</hi> with them that dwell about the Northerne Alpes in <hi>England,</hi> are as mountainous as they, and I believe have as suffering and sturdy bodies; which makes the world yield it for a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime, that no Prince of Christendom hath a better choice to make Souldiers of than the King of Great <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The <hi>Danish</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest have happened since, and the third is to follow in the same manner, say they, not by Succession, but by the Sword.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE scope of this short discourse is to make some researches after Truth, and to rectifie the world according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in point of opinion, specially touching the first <hi>Author</hi> and Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor of the late ugly war in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which brought with it such an inundation of blood, and so let in so huge a torrent of mischiefs to rush upon us. There be many, and they not only Presbyterians and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, but <hi>Cavaliers</hi> also, who think that the King had taken the guilt of all this blood upon himselfe, in regard of that Concession he passed in the preamble of the late Treaty at the <hi>Isle of Wight;</hi> The aime of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is to cleere that point, but in so temperate a way, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94588:76"/> I hope 'twill give no cause of exception, much lesse of offence to any: the blood that's sought after here, shall not be mingled with <hi>gaule,</hi> much lesse with anie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome at all.</p>
                  <p>We know there is no Principle either in <hi>Divinity, Law,</hi> or <hi>Phylosophie,</hi> but may be wrested to a wrong sense; there is no truth so demonstrative and cleere, but may be subject to cavillations; no Tenet so plaine, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse inferences may be drawne out of it; such a fate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell that preambular Concession His Majesty passed at the Transactions of the late Treaty, in that <hi>he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd therein that the two Houses of Parliament were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to undertake a war in their owne just and lawfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, &amp;c. and that therfore all Oaths, Declarations, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther public Instruments against the Houses of Parliament, or any for adhering to them, &amp;c. be declared null, suppressed, and forbidden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, His Majesty passed this grant, but with this weighty consideration, as it had reference to two ends.</p>
                  <p>First, to smoothen and facilitate things thereby to ope a passage, and pave the way to a happy peace, which this poor Iland did so thirst after, having been so long glutted with civill blood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it might conduce to the further secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the indemnifying of the two Houses of Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with all their instruments, assistants, and adherents, and so rid them of all jealousies, and fear (of future dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) which still lodg'd within them. Now touching the expressions and words of this Grant, they were not his owne, nor did he give order for the dictating or penning thereof; the King was not the <hi>Author</hi> of them, but an <hi>Assenter</hi> only unto them: nor was He or his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty accus'd, or as much as mentioned in any of them, to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94588:76"/> draw the least guilt upon themselves. Besides, He pass'd them as he doth all Lawes and Acts of Parlement, which in case of absence another may do for him in his <hi>politic</hi> capacity, therefore they cannot prejudice his <hi>person</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way. I am loth to say that he condescended to this Grant,
<q>âCÃ¹m stricta novacula supra,</q> When the razor was as it were at his throat, when ther was an Army of about thirty thousand effect if Horse and Foot that were in motion against him, when his Person had continued under a black long lingring restraint, and dangerous menacing Petitions and Papers daily obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against him. Moreover, His Majesty pass'd this Concession with these two provisos and reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>â¢â¢</desc>
                     </gap>,</p>
                  <p>First, that it should be of no vertu or validity at all, till the whole Treaty were intirely consummated.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that he might when he pleas'd inlarge and cleer the truth with the reservedness of his meaning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by public Declaration: Now the Treaty being confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly huddled up, without discussing, or as much as recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any Proposition from himself as was capitulated, (and reciprocal Proposals are of the essence of all Treaties) it could neither bind him, or turne any way to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage: Therfore under favour, ther was too much hast us'd by the Parlement, to draw that hipothetick or provisional Concession to the form of an Act so suddenly after in the very heat of the Treaty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out His Majesties knowledge, or the least intimation of his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Add hereunto, that this <hi>Grant</hi> was but a meer pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bular Proposition, 'twas not of the essence of the Treaty it self: And as the Philosophers and Schoolemen tell us, there is <hi>no valid proof can be drawn out of Proemes, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductions</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:94588:77"/> or <hi>Corallaries</hi> in any science, but out of the positive assertions and body of the Text, which is only argument-proof; so in the Constitutions and Lawes of England, as also in all accusations and charges, forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prefaces and preambles (which commonly <hi>weak</hi> causes want most) are not pleadable: and though they use to be first in place, like gentlemen-Ushers, yet are they last in dignity, as also in framing, nor had they ever the force of Lawes, but may be term'd their attendants to make way for them.</p>
                  <p>Besides, ther's not a syllable in this preface which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales or connives at any former Law of the Land, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those Lawes <hi>that so strictly inhibit English Subjects to raise armes against their liege Lord the King,</hi> and those Lawes <hi>Ã¨ contrario,</hi> which <hi>exempt from all dangers, penalties or molestation any Subject that adheres to the person of the King in any cause or quarrell whatsoever,</hi> are still in force.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, this <hi>introductory</hi> Concession of the Kings, wherein he is contented to declare, That the two Houses were necessitated to take Armes for their defence, may be said to have relation to the <hi>necessity, Ã  parte pÃ²st,</hi> not <hi>Ã  par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te antÃ¨: self-defence</hi> is the universall Law of Nature, and it extends to all other creatures, as well as the rationall: As the fluent Roman Orator in that sentence of his, which is accounted among the Critiques the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentest that ever drop'd from him; <hi>Est enim haec non scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, sed nata Lex, quam non didicimus, accepimus, legimus, verÃ¹m ex natura ipsa arripuimus, hausimus, expressimus, ad quam non docti, sed facti, non instituti, sed imbuti sumus, ut si vita nostra in</hi> &amp;c. For this (meaning self-defence) is not a written, but a Law born with us; A Law which we have not learnt, receiv'd or read, but that which we have suck'd, drawn forth, and wrung out of Nature her self; A Law to which we are not taught, but made unto,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94588:77"/> wherewith we are not instructed, but indued withall, that if our lifes be in jeopardy, &amp;c. we may repell force by force. Therefore when the House of Parliament had drawn upon them a necessity of self-defence (and I could have wish'd it had been against any other but their own Soveraign Prince) his Majesty was contented to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that necessity. As for example: A man of war meets with a Marchant man at Sea, he makes towards him, and assaults him; The Marchant man having a good stout vessell under him, and resolute generous Seamen, bears up against him, gives him a whole broad side, and shoots him 'twixt wind and water; so there happens a furious fight betwixt them, which being ended, the Marchant cannot deny but that the man of war, though the first Assailant, was necessitated to fight, and that just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his own defence, which necessity he drew upon himself, and so was excusable, <hi>Ã  posteriori,</hi> not <hi>Ã  priori;</hi> As the Civilians speak of a clandestine marriage, <hi>Fieri non debuit, sed factum valet;</hi> It ought not to have been, but being done 'tis valid: whereunto relates another saying, <hi>Multa sunt quae non nisi per acta approbantur.</hi> There are many things which are not allowable till they are pass'd.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>France</hi> have had sundry civill warrs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bloudy encounters and clashes with their Subjects, specially the last King <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, which turn'd all at last to his advantage; among other Treaties upon that of <hi>Lond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whrein the King approv'd of all that was pass'd, as done for his service, &amp;c. and these concessions and extenuations are usuall at the close of most civill warrs; but there was never any further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage made of them, then to make the adverse party
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94588:78"/> more capable of grace and pardon, to enable them to bear up against the brunt of Lawes, and secure them more firmly from all afterclaps; They were pass'd in order to an <hi>Act of Abolition,</hi> to a generall pardon, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a reestablishment of Peace; now, <hi>Peace and VVarr</hi> (we know) <hi>are like VVater and Ice, they engender one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> But I do not remember to have read either in the French story, or any other, that such Royall Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at the period of any intestin war were ever wrung so hard, as to draw any inference from them, to cast therby the guilt of blood or indeed the least stain of dishonor upon the King; For Royall Indulgences and grants of this nature are like nurses breasts, if you presse them gently there will <hi>milk</hi> come forth, if you wring them too hard you will draw forth <hi>blood</hi> in lieu of milk: And I have observed, that upon the conclusion of such Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The Irish took his rise from him: and whereas it hath been often suggested, that his Majesty had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thereof, among a world of convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which may cleer him in this particular, the Lord <hi>Maguair</hi> upon the ladder, and another upon the Scaffold, when they were ready to breath their last, and to appear
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94588:78"/> before the Tribunall of heaven, did absolutely acquit him, and that <hi>spontaneously</hi> of their own accord, being unsought unto, but only out of a love to <hi>truth,</hi> and the discharge of a good conscience: But touching those cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entous Irish warrs, in regard there was nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more advantage was made against His late Majesty, to imbitter and poison the hearts of his Subjects against him then that Rebellion, I will take leave to wind up the main causes of them upon a small bottome.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They who kept intelligence and complied with the <hi>Scot,</hi> in his first and second insurrection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They who dismiss'd the first Irish Commissioners (who came of purpose to attend our Parlement with some grievances) with such a short unpolitic harsh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They who took off <hi>Straffords</hi> head, (which had it stood on, that Rebellion had never been) and afterwards retarded the dispatch of the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> from going over to be Lord-Lievtenant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Lastly, they who hindred part of that disbanded Army of 8000. men rais'd there by the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> which His Majesty, in regard they were souldiers of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and loose casheer'd men, to prevent the mischiefs that might befall that Kingdome by their insolencies, had promised the two Spanish Ambassadors, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesses of <hi>Velada</hi> and <hi>Malvezzi,</hi> then resident in this Court: which souldiers rise up first of any, and put fire to the tumult to find somthing to do.</p>
                  <p>They, I say, who did all this, may be justly said to have been the true causes of that horrid Insurrection in Ireland; and consequently 'tis easie to judge upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of whose souls must be laid the blood of those hundred and odd thousand poor Christians who perished in that war: and had it been possible to have brought o're
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94588:79"/> their bodies unputrified to England, and to have cast them at the lower House door, and in the presence of some Members, which are now either secluded, or gone to give account in another world, I believe their noses would have gush'd out with blood for discovery of the true murtherers.</p>
                  <p>Touching this last fire-brand of warre, which was throwne into <hi>England,</hi> who kindled it first, the conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of those indifferent and unbiassed men are fittest to be judges, who have been curious to observe with impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall eyes, the carriage of things from the beginning: I confesse 'twas a fatall infortunate thing, that the King should put such a distance 'twixt his Person and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but a more fatall and barbarous thing it was, that he should be <hi>driven</hi> away from it, that there should be a desperate designe to surprize his Person, that <hi>Ven</hi> with his <hi>Myrmidons,</hi> and <hi>Bourges</hi> with his Bandogs, (for so they call'd the riffraff of the City they brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them) should rabble him away, with above four parts in five of the Lords, and neere upon two parts in three of the Commons: Yet 'tis fit it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, what reiterated Messages his Majesty sent from time to time afterward, that he was alwaies ready to return, provided there might be a course taken to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Person, with those Peers and others who were rioted from the Houses; 'tis fit it should be remembred, that there was not the least motion of war at all, till <hi>Hotham</hi> kept his Majesty out of his owne Towne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston upon Hull, where being attended by a few of his meniall Servants, he came only to visit her, which act of shutting the gates against him was voted warrantable by the House of Commons, and it may be call'd the first thunderbolt of war: 'Tis fit it should be remembred, that a while after there was a compleat Army of 16000.

                  <p>Let it be remembred, that though there be some Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents of deposing Kings in this Kingdome, and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, when there was a competition for the right Title to the Crown by some other of the <hi>blood Royall,</hi> yet 'tis a thing not only unsampled, but unheard of in any age, that a King of England whose Title was without the least scruple, shold be summon'd and arraign'd, tryed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, and executed in his own Kingdom, by his own Subjects, and by the name of their own King, to whom they had sworn Alleagiance.</p>

This businesse about the playster which was applied to King <hi>Iames,</hi> was sifted &amp; winnow'd as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly as possibly a thing could be in former Parlements, yet when it was exhibited as an Article against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> 'twas term'd but a <hi>presumption</hi> or <hi>misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanure</hi>

                  <p>And as the antient Crown and Royall Diadem of England is made of such pure allay, and cast in so dainty a mould, that it can receive no taint, or contract the least speck of enormity and foulenesse in it self, so it doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow the person of the Prince that weares it with such high Prerogative, that it exempts him from all sorts of publique blemishes, from all Attainders, Empeachments, Summons, Arraignments and Tryalls; nor is there or ever was any Law or Precedent in this Land, to lay any Crime or capitall charge against him, though touching civill matters, touching propertie of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> he may be impleaded by the meanest vassall that hath sworn fealty to him; as the Subjects of France, and Spain may against their Kings, though never so absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.</p>
                  <p>In the Constitution of England, there are two incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Maximes, whereof the meanest mootman that hath but saluted <hi>Littleton</hi> cannot be ignorant: the first is, <hi>Rex in suis Dominiis ne{que} habet Parem, nec Superiorem.</hi> The King in his own Dominions hath neither Peer, or Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. The other is <hi>Satis habet Rex ad poenam quod Deum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectet ultorem:</hi> 'Tis punishment enough for a King that God will take revenge of him. Therefore if it be the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Constitution of the Land, that all just Tryalls must be by <hi>Peers,</hi> and the Law proclaimes the King to have none in his own Dominions, I leave the world to judge, what capacity or power those men had to arraigne the late King, to be in effect his Judges, Accusers; and that an exorbitant unsampled Tribunall shold be erected,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94588:81"/> with power and purpose to <hi>condemn</hi> all that came before it, to cleer none, and that sentence of death shold passe without conviction or Law, upon him that was the head and protector of all the Lawes. Lastly, that they who by their own confession represent but the Common <hi>people,</hi> should assume power to cut off him who immediately represented God, <hi>Cui dabit partes scelus expiandi Iupiter?</hi> Well, we have seen such portentous things, that former Ages never beheld, nor will future Ages ever be witnesse of the like: And now with thoughts full of consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and horror; with a heart full of amazement and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling for the flagrant and crying sins of this forlorn Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which hath drawn such an endlesse warr, and an unheard of slaverie upon it self, I will conclude with this short prayer, which carrieth with it as much of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall charity, as of particular: God amend all, and me first.</p>
